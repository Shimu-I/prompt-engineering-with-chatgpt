## 🧩 **Module 2.8 — Prompt Anti-Patterns & Fixes (Ambiguity, Hidden Tasks)**

*(Section 1.2.2.8 of the syllabus)*

---

### **Part A: Concept Foundations**

### **What Are Prompt Anti-Patterns?**

A **prompt anti-pattern** is a recurring design mistake that *looks fine on the surface* but consistently produces **poor, confusing, or unreliable results**.

Just like software developers identify *code smells*, prompt engineers detect **prompt smells** — subtle patterns that degrade clarity, reasoning, or fidelity.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Imagine a chef giving vague recipes like “add some spice” or “cook until done.”
> 
> That’s what ambiguous prompts do to AI — they leave too much to interpretation.
>

### **Common Anti-Patterns in Prompt Engineering**

| **Category** | **Anti-Pattern** | **Problem Caused** | **Quick Fix** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ambiguity** | Vague verbs or unclear intent | AI guesses user’s goal | Use precise verbs (“summarize,” “analyze,” “compare”) |
| **Hidden Tasks** | Multiple tasks in one sentence | Model splits attention; loses focus | Separate tasks into clear numbered steps |
| **Under-Specification** | No tone, audience, or format guidance | Output varies or lacks consistency | Define audience, role, and output format |
| **Over-Prompting** | Overly long or repetitive instructions | Confuses model; conflicts between lines | Keep concise, coherent flow |
| **No Stopping Rules** | Model continues endlessly | Over-generation or topic drift | Add explicit word or section limits |

> ⚠️ Rule of Thumb:
> 
> 
> If a prompt could be interpreted in two or more ways — the model *will* pick the wrong one 50% of the time.

### **The “Hidden Task” Trap**

Hidden tasks occur when multiple cognitive actions are crammed into one instruction.

**Example of Hidden Task:**

```
Summarize this article and explain whether it’s accurate, then rewrite it as a poem.

```

The model might do one, two, or none — because **the mental load is unclear**.

✅ **Fix:**

```
Task 1: Summarize the article in 100 words.
Task 2: Evaluate its factual accuracy in 3 bullet points.
Task 3: Rewrite it as a 6-line poem.

```

Each step now defines one *intent*, ensuring predictable multi-stage reasoning.

---

### **Part B: Application and Examples**

### **Example 1 — Ambiguity Fix**

**Bad Prompt:**

```
Explain AI ethics.

```

**Problem:** Ambiguous — too broad.

**Better Prompt:**

```
Act as an AI policy researcher.
Explain AI ethics in 200 words, focusing on bias and transparency.
Include 2 real-world examples.

```

✅ Adds role, focus, and scope.

---

### **Example 2 — Over-Prompting Fix**

**Bad Prompt:**

```
Act as a professor, summarize this, explain that, list 10 examples, and make it fun and academic and engaging.

```

**Problem:** Conflicting tone and overloaded tasks.

**Better Prompt:**

```
Act as a university lecturer.
Provide a concise 200-word summary in a clear, professional tone.
Add 2 bullet-point examples at the end.

```

✅ One primary action, supporting details secondary.

---

### **Example 3 — Structural Fix for Under-Specification**

**Bad Prompt:**

```
Compare GPT-4 and Claude 3.

```

**Problem:** No context, no structure.

**Better Prompt:**

```
Compare GPT-4 and Claude 3 in a Markdown table.
Include columns: Model | Strength | Limitation | Ideal Use Case.
Limit to 5 rows.

```

✅ Predictable, formatted, evaluative.

### **Part C: Reflection, Quiz, and Mini Project**

### **Reflection Prompt**

> When was the last time your prompt confused the AI?
> 
> 
> Which anti-pattern might have caused it — ambiguity, overload, or hidden tasks?
>

### **Quick Quiz**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Define a “prompt anti-pattern.” | Short Answer |
| 2 | What is the main issue with hidden tasks? | Short Answer |
| 3 | Why does under-specification reduce quality? | Short Answer |
| 4 | Which is the best fix for over-prompting? (a) Add more detail (b) Reduce and prioritize (c) Randomize tone | MCQ |
| 5 | Rewrite this bad prompt: “Describe AI in your own words and then code it.” | Challenge |

---

### **Answer Key**

| **Q#** | **Correct Answer** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A recurring design mistake that produces poor AI responses. | Patterns that reduce clarity or control. |
| 2 | It mixes multiple reasoning paths in one prompt. | AI can’t prioritize tasks. |
| 3 | The AI lacks context or direction, leading to inconsistency. | Missing structure or tone details. |
| 4 | (b) Reduce and prioritize | Simplifying reduces confusion. |
| 5 | “Task 1: Explain AI in 100 words for beginners. Task 2: Write simple pseudocode that simulates a decision process.” | Separates conceptual and coding actions. |

### **Mini Project: Spot and Fix Anti-Patterns**

> Task Steps:
> 
> 1. Collect 3 of your old or poorly performing prompts.
> 2. Identify which anti-pattern(s) each exhibits (use table below).
> 3. Rewrite each prompt with clear instructions, structure, and limits.
> 4. Test and record improvement in accuracy or focus.

| **Prompt Issue** | **Anti-Pattern Type** | **Rewritten Fix** | **Improvement Observed** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

> 🧩 Pro-Tip: Keep an “Anti-Pattern Journal” — documenting mistakes and fixes builds long-term intuition.

### **Instructor Notes (Optional)**

| **Criterion** | **Score (1–10)** | **Focus Area** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identification accuracy |  | Correctly labeling anti-patterns |
| Rewriting effectiveness |  | Clarity and structural improvements |
| Comparative reflection |  | Depth of insight |
| Adherence to prompt hygiene |  | Concise, single-intent tasks |

---

✅ **Summary Insight:**

> Great prompt engineers don’t just create effective prompts — they recognize and eliminate weak ones.
> 
> 
> Every ambiguous or overloaded prompt is an opportunity to refine your *prompt hygiene* — clear intent, single action, structured result.
