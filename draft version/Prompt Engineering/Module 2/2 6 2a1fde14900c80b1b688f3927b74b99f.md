## 🧩 **Module 2.6 — Practice: Rewrite a Prompt to Improve Clarity**

*(Section 1.2.2.6 of the syllabus)*

---

### **Part A: Concept Foundations**

### **The Power of Prompt Rewriting**

Prompt rewriting is one of the **most valuable professional skills** in prompt engineering.

It’s not about changing words — it’s about **enhancing precision, structure, and intent alignment.**

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of your prompt as a **camera lens**.
> 
> A vague prompt is like a blurry photo — the details exist, but the focus is off.
> 
> Rewriting sharpens the image, helping the AI “see” exactly what you mean.
>

### **What Makes a Prompt “Unclear”?**

Unclear prompts often fail because they lack one or more of the following:

| **Weak Area** | **Symptom** | **Example (Problematic)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ambiguity** | Multiple interpretations | “Describe technology’s effects.” *(Which technology? What effects?)* |
| **Lack of context** | Missing target audience or purpose | “Write an article about AI.” *(For whom? What tone?)* |
| **No format** | Unstructured or inconsistent output | “List AI models.” *(List how? Table? Paragraph?)* |
| **Overload** | Too many ideas at once | “Summarize, compare, and visualize…” *(Too broad for one prompt.)* |

To improve clarity, apply **Precision Layering** — a rewrite framework for refinement.

---

### **Precision Layering Framework (R.E.S.E.T.)**

Use this when improving any prompt:

| **Step** | **Meaning** | **Goal** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R — Refocus** | Define one clear objective | Avoid multi-task prompts |
| **E — Expand Context** | Add background, role, or audience | Help the model reason with intent |
| **S — Specify Output** | Define format, length, and tone | Ensure structural predictability |
| **E — Eliminate Ambiguity** | Remove vague terms | Replace “good,” “some,” “various” with specifics |
| **T — Test and Tweak** | Run and adjust iteratively | Evaluate and refine results |

> ✍️ Rewriting isn’t correction — it’s iteration. Every round gets you closer to optimal precision.

### **Part B: Application and Examples**

### **Example 1 — From Vague to Clear**

**Original Prompt:**

```
Write about social media.

```

**Rewritten Prompt:**

```
Act as a digital marketing strategist.
Write a 300-word blog post about how social media impacts small business growth.
Use a persuasive tone and include one real-world example.

```

✅ Clearer role, audience, length, and purpose — output becomes relevant and actionable.

---

### **Example 2 — From Overloaded to Focused**

**Original Prompt:**

```
Compare AI and human creativity and explain how both are useful in business and education. Add examples and code too.

```

**Rewritten Prompt (Split and Structured):**

```
Task 1: Compare AI and human creativity using a short paragraph.
Task 2: Write 3 business use cases where both complement each other.
Task 3: Provide a short code snippet that demonstrates AI-generated creativity (e.g., poem generation).

```

✅ Breaking into steps clarifies sequence and scope — improving accuracy and readability.

---

### **Example 3 — From Unformatted to Structured**

**Original Prompt:**

```
Explain the benefits of machine learning.

```

**Rewritten Prompt:**

```
Explain the top 3 benefits of machine learning.
Provide the response in a Markdown table with columns: Benefit | Real-World Example | Impact Summary.

```

✅ Output is now structured, scannable, and presentation-ready.

### **Part C: Reflection, Quiz, and Mini Project**

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think about your last unclear AI interaction.
> 
> 
> What made your original prompt weak — lack of context, structure, or clarity?
> 
> Which part of R.E.S.E.T. could have fixed it?
>

### **Quick Quiz**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What does the R.E.S.E.T. framework stand for? | Short Answer |
| 2 | Which problem does “Refocus” solve? | Short Answer |
| 3 | What’s the main goal of “Specify Output”? | Short Answer |
| 4 | Rewrite this vague prompt: “Explain AI simply.” | Challenge |
| 5 | What’s the key difference between editing and rewriting a prompt? | Short Answer |

---

### **Answer Key**

| **Q#** | **Correct Answer** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Refocus, Expand Context, Specify Output, Eliminate Ambiguity, Test and Tweak | Framework for rewriting unclear prompts |
| 2 | It reduces confusion by keeping the task single-purpose. | Prevents overloaded or multi-task prompts. |
| 3 | To ensure consistency and predictability of the response. | Defines tone, length, and structure. |
| 4 | “Explain the concept of AI in 100 words for high school students using a simple analogy.” | Adds audience, tone, and limit. |
| 5 | Editing tweaks language; rewriting rebuilds structure for clarity. | Rewriting focuses on conceptual redesign. |

### **Mini Project: The Clarity Upgrade Challenge**

> Task Steps:
> 
> 1. Choose a real AI prompt you used in the past week.
> 2. Evaluate it using the **R.E.S.E.T. framework**.
> 3. Rewrite it to improve clarity and structure.
> 4. Run both versions in ChatGPT or another model.
> 5. Compare outputs using the table below.

| **Aspect** | **Original Prompt Result** | **Rewritten Prompt Result** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clarity |  |  |
| Relevance |  |  |
| Consistency |  |  |
| Professional Quality |  |  |

> 💡 Optional: Share rewritten prompts in your peer review group for collective scoring and critique.

### **Instructor Notes (Optional)**

| **Criterion** | **Score (1–10)** | **Focus Area** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use of R.E.S.E.T. framework |  | Completeness and discipline |
| Clarity improvement |  | Observable enhancement in result |
| Comparative analysis |  | Student’s reflection depth |
| Creativity in rewrite |  | Balance between structure and expression |

---

✅ **Summary Insight:**

> Great prompt engineers don’t just write — they refine.
> 
> 
> The skill of rewriting isn’t about verbosity, it’s about *intent precision*.
> 
> Every word should serve a purpose — to guide the AI’s reasoning exactly where you want it to go.
