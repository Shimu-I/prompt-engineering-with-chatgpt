## 🧩 **1.2.3.7 Metrics for Prompt Quality (Faithfulness, Helpfulness, Cost)**

---

### **Part A – Concept Foundations**

### **1️⃣ Why Prompt Quality Metrics Matter**

Until this point, you’ve learned how to **write**, **debug**, and **iterate** prompts.

Now it’s time to learn how to **measure** their performance — just like a software engineer measures code efficiency or accuracy.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Imagine training an athlete without tracking speed, stamina, or accuracy — improvement becomes guesswork.
> 
> Similarly, prompt engineers who don’t measure quality are just experimenting blindly.
> 
> Metrics turn intuition into mastery.
>

### **2️⃣ What Is a Prompt Quality Metric?**

A **Prompt Quality Metric** is a measurable criterion that evaluates how well a prompt produces desired results — balancing **accuracy**, **usefulness**, and **efficiency**.

The three gold standards are:

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Goal** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Faithfulness** | How true the output is to the given input or source. | Prevent hallucination. |
| **Helpfulness** | How useful and relevant the output is for the user’s goal. | Maximize utility. |
| **Cost** | How efficiently the output is generated (in tokens, time, and mental effort). | Optimize performance. |

✅ Together, these form the **FHC Framework** — a benchmark for all professional prompt evaluations.

---

### **3️⃣ Metric 1: Faithfulness**

**Definition:**

Faithfulness measures *truth alignment* — whether the AI’s answer sticks to the facts, context, and instructions provided.

> 💬 Example:
> 
> 
> **Input:** “Summarize the article on AI policy below.”
> 
> **Bad Output:** Adds opinions not present in the text.
> 
> **Good Output:** Reflects only the article’s actual content.
> 

**Common Threats to Faithfulness:**

- Hallucination (invented facts)
- Incorrect reasoning
- Ignored context boundaries
- Data contamination from previous chats

**Fix Techniques:**

- Add explicit grounding (“Only use the information in this passage.”)
- Ask for evidence citations.
- Use step-by-step verification prompts (“Explain how you derived this answer.”)

✅ *Tip:* For critical workflows, always run a **“Fact Check Pass”** prompt before finalizing.

---

### **4️⃣ Metric 2: Helpfulness**

**Definition:**

Helpfulness measures how well the AI’s response serves the *intended human need* — clarity, completeness, and actionability.

| **Dimension** | **Question to Ask** |
| --- | --- |
| **Relevance** | Did it directly address the request? |
| **Depth** | Did it provide sufficient explanation or detail? |
| **Clarity** | Is it understandable by the intended audience? |
| **Tone Fit** | Does the voice match the role or purpose? |

> 🧩 Analogy: A faithful answer is “correct,” but a helpful answer is “useful.”
> 
> 
> Faithfulness makes AI *accurate*; helpfulness makes it *human-friendly.*
> 

**Improvement Strategies:**

- Add context on user background (“Assume the reader is a beginner.”)
- Request actionable insights (“Summarize key takeaways in bullet points.”)
- Encourage reflection (“What should the user do next?”)

---

### **5️⃣ Metric 3: Cost**

**Definition:**

Cost isn’t only about API tokens or runtime — it’s the **efficiency of your interaction.**

A well-engineered prompt minimizes *time, effort, and waste.*

| **Cost Dimension** | **Example** |
| --- | --- |
| **Token Cost** | “Write concisely (under 200 words).” |
| **Cognitive Cost** | Easy-to-read instructions reduce user fatigue. |
| **Iteration Cost** | Well-designed prompts need fewer retries. |

✅ *Goal:* Achieve “High Faithfulness + High Helpfulness + Low Cost.”

---

### **6️⃣ Balancing the Metrics (The FHC Triangle)**

Visualize the **Prompt Quality Triangle**:

```
        Faithfulness
            ▲
           / \
          /   \
 Helpfulness———Cost

```

- Increasing **helpfulness** often increases **cost** (more tokens, detail).
- Increasing **cost-efficiency** can risk **helpfulness** (too short, vague).
- Expert engineers find the **sweet spot** — *faithful, helpful, efficient.*

> ⚙️ Key Principle: “Measure before you optimize.”
> 

---

### **Part B – Application and Examples**

### **Example 1 – Measuring Faithfulness**

Prompt:

> “Summarize the following research abstract accurately. Do not add interpretations.”
> 

✅ *Evaluation:*

- Factual accuracy: 9/10
- Context adherence: 10/10
- Hallucinations: 0 detected
    
    → Faithfulness Score: **9.5/10**
    

**Lesson:** Clear “no-interpretation” instructions improve grounding.

---

### **Example 2 – Measuring Helpfulness**

Prompt:

> “Explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old.”
> 

**Version A Output:** Too complex.

**Version B Prompt (improved):** “Explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old using a candy analogy and simple language.”

✅ *Evaluation:*

- Relevance: 10/10
- Clarity: 9/10
- Engagement: 8/10
    
    → Helpfulness Score: **9/10**
    

---

### **Example 3 – Measuring Cost**

Prompt A:

> “Explain neural networks thoroughly, including math formulas and historical context.”
> 
> 
> → Tokens: 1,200 | Time: 18 sec
> 

Prompt B:

> “Explain neural networks simply, with one example and a 100-word limit.”
> 
> 
> → Tokens: 320 | Time: 5 sec
> 

✅ *Trade-Off:*

A = Deep but costly

B = Efficient but less detailed

C (balanced) = Faithful (9), Helpful (8), Cost (7)

---

### **Example 4 – Combined Metric Table**

| **Prompt Version** | **Faithfulness (10)** | **Helpfulness (10)** | **Cost (10)** | **Overall Quality (%)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V1 – Vague | 6 | 5 | 9 | 67% |
| V2 – Structured | 9 | 9 | 8 | 87% |
| V3 – Detailed & Optimized | 10 | 9 | 7 | 88% |

> 📊 Conclusion: V3 gives near-optimal quality even with moderate cost — this is the engineer’s balance zone.
> 

---

### **Example 5 – Automating Evaluation**

Prompt:

```
Review this response using the FHC framework.
Rate faithfulness, helpfulness, and cost on a scale of 1–10.
Justify each score in one sentence.

```

✅ *Use Case:* Self-assessment for model output — perfect for LMS or peer grading.

### **Part C – Reflection, Quiz, and Mini Project**

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Which do you value more — faithfulness, helpfulness, or cost?
>
