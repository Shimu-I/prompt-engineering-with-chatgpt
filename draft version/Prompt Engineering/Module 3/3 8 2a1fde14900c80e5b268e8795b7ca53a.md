# 3.8

# 🧩 **1.2.3.8 Exam Section — Written Questions + Mini Interview**

This section transforms your conceptual mastery into measurable performance.

It evaluates your ability to **think like an AI**, **analyze prompt logic**, **evaluate reasoning quality**, and **iterate intelligently** — the hallmarks of a *senior prompt engineer mindset.*

---

## 🧭 **Part A – Overview and Objectives**

This module’s final evaluation has three integrated parts:

1️⃣ **Written Assessment (10 conceptual + applied questions)**

2️⃣ **Mini Interview Simulation (10 reasoning & scenario questions)**

3️⃣ **Instructor Rubric + Reflection Criteria**

> 🧠 Analogy: Think of this as your “mental gym check.”
> 
> 
> You’re not testing memory — you’re testing *how you think, debug, and reason* with an AI’s logic.
>

## 🧩 **Part B – Written Assessment (10 Questions)**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Expected Answer Summary** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Define “Prompt Engineering Mindset.” | The practice of thinking like an AI — using structured reasoning, iteration, and feedback to achieve control and precision. |
| 2 | Why is step-by-step reasoning essential in prompt engineering? | It simulates the model’s prediction process and prevents skipped logic. |
| 3 | What is task decomposition, and how does it improve output quality? | Breaking complex tasks into smaller, clearer subtasks enhances coherence and accuracy. |
| 4 | Explain the importance of evaluation loops in AI prompting. | Enables iterative refinement through analysis and measurable improvement. |
| 5 | List 3 common prompt pitfalls and their fixes. | Vague → clarify; overloaded → split tasks; schema drift → enforce format. |
| 6 | Define self-reflection loops in AI collaboration. | A process where the AI critiques, verifies, and improves its own outputs. |
| 7 | Why must prompts include constraints? | They anchor the model’s creativity and reduce unpredictable results. |
| 8 | What is the FHC framework? | Faithfulness–Helpfulness–Cost; used to measure prompt quality quantitatively. |
| 9 | How do reasoning and evaluation complement each other? | Reasoning structures the thought process; evaluation tests its validity and fidelity. |
| 10 | Explain how a professional prompt engineer balances creativity and control. | By alternating divergent (creative) and convergent (structured) prompt phases. |

✅ *Tip:* These questions assess *depth of understanding* — write answers that combine reasoning + example.

## 🧠 **Part C – Mini Interview (10 Applied + Reasoning Questions)**

This simulation is designed to mimic real-world prompt engineer interviews, focusing on *scenario-based reasoning* and *iterative problem solving.*

| **Q#** | **Interview Question** | **Evaluator Notes (Ideal Response Focus)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | You ask ChatGPT to summarize a research paper, but it adds unrelated examples. What’s your diagnosis and fix? | Problem: low faithfulness → add “Use only text provided.” |
| 2 | The AI produces creative content but ignores factual accuracy. What adjustment would you make? | Reduce temperature, increase grounding instructions. |
| 3 | How would you explain Chain-of-Thought prompting to a non-technical stakeholder? | “It teaches AI to reason out loud before answering — like showing its math.” |
| 4 | Describe how you’d structure a prompt for a 3-phase workflow (idea → outline → review). | Define step prompts and pass each result forward. |
| 5 | What’s your process when a prompt produces partial or incomplete answers? | Apply Ask–Verify–Revise loop; add “Continue from last step.” |
| 6 | How would you test prompt quality systematically? | Use FHC metrics and comparative evaluation. |
| 7 | If a model misinterprets tone, what’s your debug method? | Define role and audience; include explicit tone descriptors. |
| 8 | Give one example of a self-correcting prompt. | “Write an answer, critique it for tone and clarity, then rewrite it.” |
| 9 | Explain how you’d design a safe prompt for AI red-teaming (safety testing). | Add role: “Act as safety evaluator,” use refusal criteria and bias checks. |
| 10 | If asked to improve team prompt documentation, what 3 practices would you recommend? | Version control, evaluation logs, standardized templates. |

✅ *Pro Insight:* Interviewers assess whether you can **reason transparently**, **design prompt experiments**, and **speak in structured logic.**

## 🧩 **Part D – Short Scenario Challenge**

> Scenario: You’ve been asked to create a prompt that helps ChatGPT act as an “AI Journal Reviewer.”
> 
> 
> It must evaluate a paper abstract for clarity, relevance, and novelty, scoring each from 1–10.
> 

**Task:**

1️⃣ Write the initial prompt.

2️⃣ Run an internal *critique loop* to improve it.

3️⃣ Rewrite the improved version.

**Expected Elements:**

- Role definition (AI Journal Reviewer)
- Clear criteria (Clarity, Relevance, Novelty)
- Structured output format (table or JSON)
- Self-reflection step (“Evaluate your response for completeness.”)

✅ *This exercise tests your ability to operationalize everything learned in Module 3.*

## 🧮 **Part E – Rubric: Evaluation Criteria**

| **Dimension** | **Max Points** | **Indicators of Mastery** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conceptual Understanding | 25 | Clear definitions and frameworks (CoT, decomposition, FHC). |
| Analytical Reasoning | 25 | Logical explanations, self-critique, and structured thinking. |
| Application Skill | 25 | Can design, evaluate, and refine real prompts effectively. |
| Reflection & Ethics | 15 | Aware of bias, limitations, and responsibility. |
| Communication Clarity | 10 | Expresses ideas with professional precision. |
| **Total** | **100 pts** |  |

## 🧾 **Part F – Scoring Levels**

| **Score Range** | **Proficiency Level** | **Descriptor** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **90–100** | ⭐ **Expert Prompt Architect** | Demonstrates advanced logic, reflective iteration, and design excellence. |
| **75–89** | ✅ **Proficient Practitioner** | Understands frameworks; applies them effectively with minor tuning. |
| **60–74** | ⚙️ **Developing Engineer** | Knows core concepts; struggles with refinement or metric balance. |
| **<60** | 🧩 **Beginner Level** | Needs to strengthen logical and evaluative reasoning. |

## 🧩 **Part G – Reflection Assignment (Post-Exam)**

> Prompt:
> 
> 
> “Write a 150–200 word reflection on how your thinking about AI changed after completing Module 3.
> 
> Include: (1) how you evaluate outputs differently, (2) what iteration means to you now, and (3) how you plan to apply FHC metrics going forward.”
> 

✅ This reflection consolidates the “Prompt Engineering Mindset” — not just as a skillset, but as a *way of reasoning*.

---

## 🧩 **Instructor Extensions (Optional)**

| **Activity** | **Goal** |
| --- | --- |
| Peer Review Round | Students critique each other’s prompt versions for FHC quality. |
| Oral Defense | Learner explains one prompt choice under time pressure (simulated interview). |
| Live Debugging Challenge | Instructor presents a broken prompt — learner fixes it in real-time. |

---

✅ **Summary Insight:**

> Module 3 graduates move beyond writing good prompts — they design thinking systems.
> 
> 
> They don’t rely on luck, but on structure.
> 
> They don’t chase output, but refine reasoning.
> 
> With reflection, evaluation, and measurable quality metrics, you now think *as the model thinks* — and engineer *as a human should.*
