## **🧩 Comprehensive Answer Key (Rebux Format)**

| **Q#** | **Answer** | **Explanation (Rebux)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A prompt engineer is evolving from a “model whisperer” into a **system architect** — designing reasoning workflows, evaluation layers, and governance logic. | Modern roles require both technical fluency and ethical accountability. |
| 2 | Prompt writing is crafting *one-off instructions*; prompt engineering involves **designing structured systems** that integrate evaluation, testing, and optimization. | Engineering adds iteration and metrics. |
| 3 | Organize your GitHub portfolio by **project type (e.g., RAG, ADA, Ethics)** and include a README, changelog, and live demos. | Structure and clarity reflect professionalism. |
| 4 | Use the **CAR (Challenge–Action–Result)** framework in résumé bullets to emphasize results. | “Improved prompt accuracy by 25%” shows impact, not activity. |
| 5 | Share project breakdowns, write posts on LLM ethics, and engage in AI discussions. | Visibility builds credibility. |
| 6 | Selling a prompt that manipulates user emotion for profit poses an ethical conflict. The solution: **refuse unethical work** and apply ACHIEVE to guide integrity. | Profit must not override principles. |
| 7 | Choose **Freelance** for flexibility, **Consulting** for strategic influence, and **SaaS** for scalability. | Match your goals with business sustainability. |
| 8 | GitHub Pages and MkDocs allow you to present **searchable, public documentation** that’s professional and transparent. | Employers value visible, versioned documentation. |
| 9 | Use GitHub PRs, shared Notion docs, or Slack threads for collaborative review. | Peer feedback ensures quality and mitigates bias. |
| 10 | Translate technical feedback into user language — clarify the *why* before defending the *how.* | Communication bridges skill gaps. |
| 11 | Metrics demonstrate accountability and reproducibility. | They transform intuition into measurable progress. |
| 12 | Use multi-part prompts: knowledge + scenario + reflection. | Evaluates both reasoning and values. |
| 13 | ACHIEVE highlights **Accuracy, Clarity, Honesty, Impartiality, Empathy, Verifiability, Explainability.** | Embedding it in documentation builds trust. |
| 14 | Assign agent “roles” with explicit ownership of data, prompts, or outcomes. | Prevents ethical diffusion in AI teams. |
| 15 | Use structured logging or ADA-based scoring dashboards. | Converts subjective prompt performance into quantifiable data. |
| 16 | Maintain a **central ethics checklist** and consistent refusal templates across all deliverables. | Ensures brand integrity in commercial scaling. |
| 17 | Build an internal training deck explaining prompt patterns, guardrails, and debugging practices. | Encourages skill transfer and consistency. |
| 18 | Automate user input → output pipelines, integrate billing via Stripe, and add version logs. | Converts service into a sustainable product. |
| 19 | Track user engagement, output accuracy, and usage frequency. | ADA can visualize prompt performance trends. |
| 20 | A Master Prompt Engineer demonstrates **ethical reflexivity** — knowing not only how to make AI think, but how to make it *think right.* | The difference lies in responsibility and design philosophy. |
