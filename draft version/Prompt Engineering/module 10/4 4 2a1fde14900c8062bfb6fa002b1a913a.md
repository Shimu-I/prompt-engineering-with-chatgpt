## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Purpose of Interview Preparation**

A prompt engineering interview tests more than just syntax or creativity. It evaluates **how you think, structure reasoning, handle ambiguity, and apply ethical awareness** in real-world situations.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Interviewing for a prompt engineering role is like being asked to **pilot a new aircraft midair** — you’re expected to explain not only how you fly it, but how you make sure it doesn’t crash.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Prompt Engineering Interview: A structured evaluation of a candidate’s ability to design, evaluate, and improve AI systems through prompt logic, reasoning patterns, safety awareness, and applied technical frameworks.
>

## **Part C – Reflection, Answer Key (Rebux), and Practice**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Pick 5 questions from different sections and write your answers as if in a live interview.
> 
> 
> Focus on clarity, reasoning, and applied ethics — not just “right” answers.
> 
> *Then ask yourself:*
> 
> - Did I explain *how* I think, not just *what* I know?
> - Did I include real examples or results?
> - Did I mention evaluation or safety awareness?
