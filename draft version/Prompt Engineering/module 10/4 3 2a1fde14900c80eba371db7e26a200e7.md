# 🧩 **1.4.4.3 Building a Prompt Portfolio on GitHub**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Why a Prompt Portfolio Matters**

In today’s AI landscape, employers and clients don’t just want to *hear* that you understand prompt engineering — they want to **see it**.

A **Prompt Portfolio** is your living résumé — a collection of **projects, prompts, evaluations, and case studies** demonstrating your real skill.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> A prompt portfolio is like a **GitHub repo for your thinking process.**
> 
> It doesn’t just show code — it shows *clarity, logic, reasoning, and responsibility* in prompt design.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Prompt Portfolio: A structured and public collection of prompt projects, experiments, evaluations, and documentation designed to demonstrate a professional’s capability in AI design, reasoning, and ethics.
>

### **2️⃣ The 4 Pillars of a Strong Prompt Portfolio**

| **Pillar** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Breadth** | Demonstrates range of prompt types and use cases. | Persona design, RAG, ADA, automation prompts. |
| **2. Depth** | Shows detailed reasoning and iteration process. | Version logs, prompt refinement, evaluations. |
| **3. Ethics** | Highlights awareness of bias, safety, and transparency. | Includes bias audits or risk notes per project. |
| **4. Documentation** | Clear explanations and version control. | README files, code comments, JSON schemas. |

✅ Each project should read like an *open-source lab notebook* for AI reasoning.

---

### **3️⃣ Recommended GitHub Folder Structure**

| **Folder / File** | **Purpose** | **Example Content** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/projects/` | Individual prompt experiments. | `persona-designer.md`, `rag-evaluator.md` |
| `/evals/` | Results from testing and audits. | Bias reports, accuracy metrics. |
| `/templates/` | Reusable prompt frameworks. | JSON or Markdown templates. |
| `/docs/` | Portfolio documentation. | “Prompt Ethics Policy.md” |
| `README.md` | Main project overview. | Summary, roadmap, contact info. |
| `LICENSE.md` | Usage rights & attribution. | MIT, CC BY-NC, etc. |

✅ *Pro Tip:* Treat every project like an **open-source contribution to the AI ethics community.**

---

### **4️⃣ The Prompt Documentation Standard**

Every prompt project in your portfolio should answer **five essential questions:**

1. 🎯 **Goal:** What problem does this prompt solve?
2. 🧠 **Design:** What structure or pattern does it use? (Persona, CoT, RAG, etc.)
3. 🔍 **Evaluation:** How do you measure success? (Accuracy, faithfulness, safety)
4. ⚙️ **Iterations:** What refinements did you make and why?
5. 🌱 **Ethical Notes:** Are there risks, mitigations, or disclaimers?

✅ Consistency here shows your **professional maturity** and **process discipline**.

---

### **5️⃣ GitHub Features Every Prompt Engineer Should Use**

| **Feature** | **Purpose** | **Example Use** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **README.md** | Showcase each project’s summary and key results. | Project overviews with badges or visuals. |
| **Issues & Discussions** | Capture public feedback and collaboration. | Community testing on prompt outputs. |
| **GitHub Pages** | Turn your repo into a live portfolio site. | Host your prompts like case studies. |
| **Commits & Version Tags** | Show evolution of prompt iterations. | `v1.0 → v1.1 – Improved hallucination control.` |
| **Markdown Tables** | Present structured evaluations. | Accuracy or bias report tables. |

✅ Employers value **documentation clarity** as much as creativity.

---

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Project Folder (Persona Pattern Prompt)**

```
📂 projects/
   └── persona-expert.md

```

**Contents:**

```markdown
### Project Title: Expert Persona for Marketing Copy
**Goal:** Generate tone-consistent ad copy for multiple platforms.
**Prompt:**
"Act as a brand strategist. Create ad copy in the tone of our product’s voice guide."
**Evaluation:** Tested across 5 products; 92% alignment accuracy.
**Ethical Note:** Avoided gendered language or cultural stereotypes.

```

✅ *Demonstrates structure, testing, and ethical awareness.*

---

### **Example 2 – Evaluation Folder (Prompt Testing Results)**

```
📂 evals/
   └── persona-eval-results.json

```

**Sample JSON:**

```json
{
  "prompt_version": "v1.3",
  "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
  "accuracy_score": 0.91,
  "bias_score": 0.02,
  "remarks": "Improved clarity; reduced overfitting to examples."
}

```

✅ Shows measurable metrics — not vague claims.

---

### **Example 3 – GitHub Pages Presentation**

Your repo → Hosted via **GitHub Pages** → Publicly visible at:

> https://username.github.io/prompt-portfolio/
> 

Each project appears as a case study with:

- Summary
- Prompt version history
- Visuals (charts, flow diagrams)
- Evaluation reports

✅ Turns your portfolio into a professional AI résumé.

---

### **Example 4 – Portfolio Ethics Statement**

Every repository should include a **short ethical statement**, e.g.:

> “All prompts in this repository follow the ACHIEVE framework.
> 
> 
> Outputs are tested for bias, hallucination, and reproducibility.
> 
> No personally identifiable or sensitive data was used in any dataset.”
> 

✅ Adds credibility and aligns with industry best practices (OpenAI, Anthropic, and EU AI Act standards).

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Mini Project**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> What story does your GitHub portfolio currently tell about your professional identity?
> 
> 
> Does it showcase *technical power*, *ethical responsibility*, and *creative adaptability* in balance?
>
