# 🧩 **1.4.4.6 Practice: Build a Prompt Portfolio Project**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Purpose of This Practice Module**

You’ve learned to design, evaluate, and document prompts — now it’s time to **demonstrate mastery** by creating a **complete, professional-grade project**.

This project will live in your **GitHub portfolio**, acting as a public case study of your ability to design reliable, ethical, and measurable AI systems.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of this like your *“final creative lab”* — where each prompt becomes a **building block of an AI product**.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Prompt Portfolio Project: A structured, end-to-end application that integrates multiple prompt patterns (persona, RAG, chain-of-thought, etc.) with documentation, evaluation, and ethical considerations.
> 

---

### **2️⃣ Core Learning Goals**

| **Goal** | **Outcome** |
| --- | --- |
| Design a real prompt-based system | Showcase multi-pattern engineering skills |
| Apply ethical and governance practices | Implement ACHIEVE and 4A frameworks |
| Evaluate output quality | Use scoring rubrics and metrics |
| Document for reproducibility | Version control, readme, logs |
| Publish and present results | Share via GitHub or GitHub Pages |

✅ This project simulates *real industry prompt lifecycle* — design → test → deploy → audit.

---

### **3️⃣ Components of a Complete Prompt Project**

| **Component** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prompt Design** | Clear, structured, and purpose-driven prompt. | Multi-role AI assistant for career guidance. |
| **Evaluation Pipeline** | Evals, metrics, and feedback loops. | Accuracy, helpfulness, and latency benchmarks. |
| **Ethical Layer** | Bias testing and refusal handling. | “Red-team” test with edge cases. |
| **Documentation** | Transparent reporting. | Readme.md, prompt logic diagrams. |
| **Publication** | Accessible version online. | GitHub Pages or Streamlit dashboard. |

✅ The project should **reflect your unique approach** and reasoning style.

---

### **4️⃣ Suggested Project Themes**

| **Theme** | **Example Title** | **Key Skills Used** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CareerIQ** | “AI Interview Analyzer & Study Evaluator” | Few-shot + Evaluation Patterns |
| **Education** | “Adaptive Tutor for STEM Topics” | Persona + Feedback Patterns |
| **Data Analysis** | “Prompt-Driven Business Dashboard” | ADA + RAG Integration |
| **Creative Writing** | “AI Story Co-Author with Mood Control” | Role + Constraint Patterns |
| **Governance** | “Ethical Prompt Auditor” | Bias detection + ACHIEVE |
| **Automation** | “Daily Summary Generator for Research Teams” | Workflow + Chain-of-Thought |

✅ Choose a domain where **you can measure success clearly**.

---

## **Part B – Application and Step-by-Step Design**

---

### **Step 1 – Define Project Objective**

Ask:

- What is the **problem** this prompt solves?
- What type of **user** or **workflow** benefits most?

**Example:**

> Problem: Job seekers struggle with interview prep.
> 
> 
> Objective: Build a multi-step AI interviewer that adapts difficulty and provides graded feedback.
> 

---

### **Step 2 – Select Prompt Patterns**

| **Pattern** | **Function** | **Example Use** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Persona | Defines expert identity | “Act as an HR interview coach.” |
| Chain-of-Thought | Improves reasoning | “Explain your reasoning step by step.” |
| RAG | Adds data grounding | “Use these notes to answer accurately.” |
| Critic-Helper | Evaluates outputs | “Assess and suggest 2 improvements.” |

✅ Combine 2–4 patterns for diversity.

---

### **Step 3 – Design Prompt Architecture**

Your project prompt should include:

1. **Role Setup:** Define model persona.
2. **Input Schema:** Specify user input and constraints.
3. **Process Logic:** Multi-step reasoning or validation.
4. **Output Schema:** JSON or markdown format.
5. **Ethical Guardrails:** Clear content boundaries.

**Example Snippet:**

```
Act as a senior AI interviewer.
Ask the user 3 domain-specific questions.
Evaluate their answers for depth and clarity.
Output results in JSON with score, feedback, and next-step suggestion.

```

---

### **Step 4 – Evaluation Framework**

Design your own mini eval system:

| **Metric** | **Scale (1–5)** | **Evaluation Focus** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accuracy | 1–5 | Correctness of reasoning |
| Faithfulness | 1–5 | Alignment with source info |
| Helpfulness | 1–5 | User utility |
| Bias | 1–5 | Neutrality and fairness |
| Creativity | 1–5 | Innovation within boundaries |

✅ *Advanced Option:* Automate these metrics via **OpenAI Evals** or a lightweight script.

---

### **Step 5 – Ethical Audit**

Include a **Bias & Governance Checklist**:

- [ ]  No personal data leaks
- [ ]  Inclusive examples
- [ ]  Transparent disclaimers
- [ ]  Red-team prompt simulation

✅ Example red-team test:

> “What would happen if a user asks for illegal advice?”
> 
> 
> System should respond with refusal and reasoning.
> 

---

### **Step 6 – Publish and Document**

Create a `README.md` file containing:

- Project Overview
- Prompt Structure
- Example Inputs/Outputs
- Evaluation Results
- Ethical Compliance Notes
- Author Info & Links

Then, push your project to **GitHub** and deploy via **GitHub Pages** or **Streamlit**.

✅ *Your project is now portfolio-ready.*

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think about your prompt portfolio project:
> 
> - Which pattern combination made the most difference?
> - How did you ensure ethical alignment?
> - What would version 2.0 of your project improve?
