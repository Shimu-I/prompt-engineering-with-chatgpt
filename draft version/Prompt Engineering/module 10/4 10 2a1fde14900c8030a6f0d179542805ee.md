### **Section 2: Scenario-Based Tasks (5 of 200)**

1️⃣ Your AI summarizer adds bias toward Western sources — how do you detect and mitigate it?

2️⃣ A prompt designed for medical advice starts outputting diagnoses — what ethical fix applies?

3️⃣ A client requests a prompt that manipulates emotions for marketing — what’s your response?

4️⃣ How do you evaluate a multi-agent debate prompt for fairness?

5️⃣ A LangChain pipeline produces inconsistent results — where do you debug first?

✅ *These evaluate critical thinking, not memorization.*

---

### **Section 3: Design and Debug Tasks (5 of 150)**

- Design a “Chain-of-Thought” prompt that explains reasoning for math problems.
- Revise a vague marketing prompt into a structured JSON-safe instruction.
- Create a bias-detection sub-prompt for a chatbot.
- Implement a ReAct prompt for decision-making workflows.
- Write an evaluation rubric for a summarization system.

✅ *Hands-on application of creative logic and structure.*

---

### **Section 4: Ethical Audit (5 of 100)**

Each question asks you to apply **ACHIEVE**, **RAG**, and **4A Governance** models.

> Example: “Audit this political analysis prompt for bias, transparency, and mitigation.”
>
