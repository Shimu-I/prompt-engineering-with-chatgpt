# Capstone I

# 🧩 **Capstone I: Specialized AI Assistant**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Purpose of the Capstone**

The goal of Capstone I is to **synthesize all your prompt engineering, evaluation, and ethical design knowledge** into a single working product:

a **Specialized AI Assistant** built, tested, and documented from scratch.

> 🧠 Analogy:

> 
> This is your “graduation performance.”
> 
> Every prompt pattern you’ve practiced now plays its part in an orchestra of reasoning, ethics, and automation.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Specialized AI Assistant:
> 
> 
> A domain-focused, prompt-driven system designed to solve a specific problem through structured reasoning, multi-pattern integration, and responsible AI behavior.
>

### **4️⃣ The 5 Pillars of a Specialized AI Assistant**

| **Pillar** | **Function** | **Tools/Frameworks** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prompt Design** | Core logic, roles, and structure | ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini |
| **Data Integration** | External context feeding | RAG / API connectors |
| **Evaluation Layer** | Output validation & scoring | ADA / Evals / custom Python scripts |
| **Ethical Guardrails** | Policy and safety rules | ACHIEVE / refusal logic |
| **Documentation & UI** | Presentation & transparency | MkDocs / Streamlit / Notion |

✅ These pillars ensure balance between *performance, trust, and usability.*

---

## **Part B – Application and Build Plan**

---

### **Step 1 – Define Your Assistant’s Mission**

Ask:

> What user problem does my assistant solve?Why does it need specialized reasoning?What makes it ethical, transparent, and useful?
> 

**Example:**

> “CareerIQ Assistant — an AI that conducts mock interviews, evaluates responses using ADA, and gives human-like coaching feedback.”
> 

✅ Write your assistant’s **Mission Statement (2 lines max)** — this becomes your prompt’s north star.

---

### **Step 2 – Design Core Prompt Framework**

Every assistant needs a **multi-layered prompt architecture:**

1️⃣ **System Prompt:**

Defines the assistant’s identity and constraints.

```markdown
You are a professional AI Career Coach specializing in behavioral interviews.
Always give feedback using the STAR (Situation–Task–Action–Result) framework.
Be encouraging but objective.

```

2️⃣ **User Prompt:**

Input schema for the user’s query.

```markdown
User input: “Tell me about a time you worked under pressure.”

```

3️⃣ **Response Logic (Few-shot / CoT):**

Instructs model to reason step-by-step.

```markdown
Analyze the response by identifying STAR components.
Rate clarity, relevance, and reflection (1–5).
Give one actionable improvement.

```

4️⃣ **Output Schema:**

Ensures structured response format.

```json
{
  "rating": 4,
  "feedback": "Add more measurable results.",
  "improvement_tip": "Quantify your success with data."
}

```

✅ Your assistant must always output structured, explainable reasoning.

---

### **Step 3 – Add Data and Evaluation Layer**

Integrate **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** or **ADA (Advanced Data Analysis)** for smarter context.

**Example (CareerIQ):**

- Feed candidate’s résumé or job description.
- Compare answers against job criteria.
- Evaluate gaps via ADA scripts.

✅ *Outcome:* Context-aware feedback, not generic responses.

---

### **Step 4 – Ethical and Governance Layer**

Apply the **ACHIEVE Framework**:

| **Aspect** | **Example Implementation** |
| --- | --- |
| Accuracy | Use verified data; validate metrics. |
| Clarity | Show reasoning steps. |
| Honesty | Include “AI-generated” disclaimer. |
| Impartiality | Avoid gendered or cultural bias. |
| Empathy | Provide respectful tone. |
| Verifiability | Link evidence or criteria. |
| Explainability | Transparent scoring and logic. |

✅ Add **Red-Team Tests:**

> “What if a user requests confidential info?”
> 
> 
> Response: “I’m not authorized to handle private or sensitive data.”
> 

---

### **Step 5 – Evaluation and Scoring**

Use your own eval matrix or ADA metrics:

| **Metric** | **Scale (1–5)** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Faithfulness | 1–5 | Accuracy vs source |
| Helpfulness | 1–5 | Practical value |
| Ethics | 1–5 | Safety & compliance |
| UX Consistency | 1–5 | Tone and coherence |
| Latency | 1–5 | Response efficiency |

✅ Log scores automatically for reproducibility.

---

### **Step 6 – Documentation & Publishing**

Structure using MkDocs or Notion:

```
📁 Specialized-AI-Assistant/
 ├── README.md
 ├── prompts/
 │    ├── system.md
 │    ├── evals.md
 │    └── ethics.md
 ├── examples/
 ├── changelog.md
 └── deployment.md

```

Deploy public docs via **GitHub Pages** or host your assistant with **Streamlit / Replit**.

✅ Include version number and disclaimer in every deployment.

---

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Mini Project**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> What made your assistant “specialized”?
> 
> 
> Did you integrate reasoning, ethics, and evaluation together?
> 
> How would you scale it to serve 10 000 users without losing transparency?
>
