# Bonus Interview Question Set

# 🎓 **Module 4 – Bonus Interview Question Set (20 Questions)**

---

## 🧩 **Section A – Conceptual Understanding (Foundations)**

**1️⃣** Define the term *Prompt Pattern* and explain its role in AI reasoning.

**2️⃣** What makes a **Persona Pattern** different from a generic role instruction?

**3️⃣** Explain how the **Audience Persona Pattern** changes the same content’s output.

**4️⃣** Why is the **Question Refinement Pattern** considered a “pre-reasoning” technique?

**5️⃣** Describe the **Cognitive Verifier Pattern** in one sentence.

**6️⃣** What is the primary risk of skipping the verification phase in prompt design?

**7️⃣** In what ways do constraints improve reliability in generated outputs?

**8️⃣** Explain why the **Outline-First Pattern** prevents logical drift in long-form outputs.

**9️⃣** What’s the relationship between **style transfer** and **brand consistency**?

**🔟** How do modular patterns help in enterprise-scale automation?

## 🧠 **Section B – Applied Pattern Scenarios**

**11️⃣** You’re designing prompts for a customer service chatbot.

Which **two patterns** would ensure empathy *and* clarity?

**12️⃣** A model gives generic summaries without depth.

Which pattern would fix this, and what’s the first refinement step?

**13️⃣** You need an AI that writes like an expert and checks its own reasoning.

Which combination of patterns should you use?

**14️⃣** A marketing AI keeps generating overlong, flashy content.

How would you control this behavior using style-based constraints?

**15️⃣** An executive summary must be tailored for different audiences (CEO, developer, journalist).

Which pattern structure achieves this?

**16️⃣** You want a model to simulate a **team of experts** collaborating on a complex task.

Which advanced Persona technique applies here?

**17️⃣** During a code generation task, the AI keeps producing errors.

How can the **Cognitive Verifier Pattern** minimize this?

**18️⃣** You want the AI to first **plan an article**, then write it section by section.

Which pattern combination fits best?

**19️⃣** An educational assistant must produce content for *three reading levels*.

Which pattern ensures consistent tone adaptation?

**20️⃣** You need an AI that not only generates answers but also *scores its own quality*.

Which hybrid pattern approach should you implement?

# ✅ **Answer Key & Explanations**

| **Q#** | **Correct Answer** | **Explanation (Rebux)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A reusable framework that defines how AI structures thought and expression. | Patterns act as logic scaffolds for generation. |
| 2 | Persona pattern defines reasoning style, not just voice. | It influences logic, tone, and cognitive approach. |
| 3 | It adjusts complexity, tone, and vocabulary for audience needs. | Focuses on who the AI speaks *to*. |
| 4 | It cleans and clarifies input before the reasoning process. | Reduces ambiguity → higher faithfulness. |
| 5 | A self-checking pattern where AI verifies its reasoning before output. | Adds an internal quality control loop. |
| 6 | Risk of hallucinations, bias, or factual inconsistency. | No verification = unreliable reasoning. |
| 7 | Keeps model outputs precise and aligned with task boundaries. | Structure = predictability. |
| 8 | Creates skeleton before text, ensuring flow and balance. | Prevents topic drift. |
| 9 | Enforces uniform tone and emotional consistency across outputs. | Used in brand or UX design. |
| 10 | Enables modular reuse of patterns across large workflows. | Reduces re-engineering effort. |
| 11 | Audience Persona + Style Transfer. | Empathy (tone) + Clarity (structure). |
| 12 | Question Refinement Pattern; identify vague terms and clarify intent. | Improves specificity and completeness. |
| 13 | Persona + Cognitive Verifier. | Expert reasoning + internal QA. |
| 14 | Add Tone, Word, and Length Constraints in Style Transfer prompt. | Restrains verbosity and bias. |
| 15 | Audience Persona Pattern. | Tailors response to reader type. |
| 16 | Multi-Persona / Dual Persona Pattern. | Simulates interdisciplinary collaboration. |
| 17 | Add “simulate and test” phase with verifier instruction. | Prevents faulty logic before code finalization. |
| 18 | Outline-First + Output Planning. | Phase-based structure → clarity. |
| 19 | Audience Persona + Style Transfer. | Adjusts tone across reading levels. |
| 20 | Expert Persona + Cognitive Verifier + Evaluation Metrics. | Self-scoring hybrid design (meta prompt). |
