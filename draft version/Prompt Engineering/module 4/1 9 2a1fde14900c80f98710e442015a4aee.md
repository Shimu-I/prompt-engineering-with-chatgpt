# 🧩 **1.3.1.9 Exam Section — Pattern Matching + Practical Task**

---

## 🎓 **Part A – Overview**

The goal of this section is to **evaluate mastery of structured prompting** — testing your ability to identify, design, and apply various **Prompt Patterns** accurately.

By the end, you’ll demonstrate:

1. Conceptual recognition (pattern identification)
2. Applied reasoning (choosing the right pattern)
3. Output evaluation (pattern-based QA)
4. Creative synthesis (pattern combinations)

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> This exam is like testing whether you can play *any melody* — not just remember the notes.
> 
> You must *recognize patterns* and *compose with them intelligently.*

## 🧩 **Part B – Written Assessment (10 Questions)**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Expected Answer Summary** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Define “Prompt Pattern” in your own words. | A reusable logical framework that structures AI thinking and response style. |
| 2 | What’s the difference between Persona Pattern and Audience Persona Pattern? | Persona = who AI is; Audience Persona = who AI talks to. |
| 3 | What is the main goal of the Question Refinement Pattern? | To clarify intent, scope, and structure before generating an answer. |
| 4 | List the three steps of the Cognitive Verifier Pattern. | Generate → Verify → Revise. |
| 5 | Why does the Outline-First Pattern improve coherence? | It makes AI plan before producing content. |
| 6 | What’s the core function of constraints in prompt design? | Limit output for precision, safety, and consistency. |
| 7 | How do planning and persona patterns work together? | Persona sets *who* is speaking; planning defines *how* ideas unfold. |
| 8 | What’s the difference between a reasoning pattern and a style pattern? | Reasoning = logic flow; Style = tone and linguistic form. |
| 9 | Define “pattern stacking” and give an example. | Combining multiple prompt patterns for layered control (e.g., Persona + Verifier). |
| 10 | How do you verify whether a pattern worked effectively? | Check faithfulness, helpfulness, and adherence to structure (FHC). |

## 🧠 **Part C – Interview-Style Questions (10 Applied + Scenario-Based)**

| **Q#** | **Interview Question** | **Evaluator Notes (Ideal Focus)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | You need a concise yet empathetic customer reply. Which patterns apply? | Audience Persona + Style Transfer. |
| 12 | The AI keeps giving shallow summaries. Which pattern fixes this? | Question Refinement (clarify scope + depth). |
| 13 | You want AI to check its reasoning before output. What pattern? | Cognitive Verifier. |
| 14 | To create a multi-section eBook, which pattern chain would you use? | Outline-First → Style Transfer → Audience Persona. |
| 15 | What’s the biggest risk of not defining constraints? | Inconsistent, verbose, or off-brand outputs. |
| 16 | How could you make AI collaborate between two expert roles? | Dual Persona / Multi-Agent Prompting. |
| 17 | Explain how you’d evaluate a student’s prompt using FHC metrics. | Assess faithfulness, helpfulness, cost efficiency. |
| 18 | You need consistent tone across 10 blog posts. Which pattern ensures this? | Style Transfer + Constraints. |
| 19 | How would you teach prompt design to a beginner using patterns? | Introduce Persona, Refinement, and Outline-First in sequence. |
| 20 | Describe how prompt patterns enable automation in enterprise AI workflows. | They provide modular, reusable prompt logic for scalable outputs. |

## 🧩 **Part D – Practical Task: Pattern Matching Challenge**

> Instructions:
> 
> 
> Identify which prompt pattern(s) best solve each of the following cases and justify why.
> 
> Then, rewrite the prompt using that pattern.
> 

| **Scenario** | **Problem** | **Best Pattern(s)** | **Example Rewrite** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | The AI produces long, unfocused essays. | Outline-First Pattern | “First, create a 3-section outline for this essay. Then expand each section to 150 words.” |
| B | The response tone is too casual for business readers. | Style Transfer + Constraints | “Rewrite in formal corporate tone under 120 words.” |
| C | Model adds inaccurate info. | Cognitive Verifier Pattern | “Answer, then verify your facts before finalizing.” |
| D | You want different levels of technical explanation. | Audience Persona | “Explain to beginner, intermediate, and expert audiences.” |
| E | You’re training a QA agent to review AI outputs. | Persona + Verifier | “Act as a quality reviewer evaluating clarity and consistency.” |

✅ *Deliverable:* Students write their own version of the rewritten prompt with rationale.

## 🧮 **Part E – Scoring Rubric**

| **Dimension** | **Points** | **Indicators of Mastery** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pattern Recognition | 25 | Identifies correct pattern for scenario. |
| Application Accuracy | 25 | Correct structure and syntax of pattern use. |
| Creative Integration | 20 | Combines multiple patterns effectively. |
| Evaluation Logic | 20 | Uses FHC or verification reasoning. |
| Reflection Insight | 10 | Demonstrates self-awareness and improvement plan. |
| **Total** | **100 pts** |  |

---

## 📘 **Part F – Reflection Prompts**

> Reflect in 150–200 words on the following:
> 
> 
> 1️⃣ Which pattern do you naturally use most often (Persona, Verifier, Outline, etc.)?
> 
> 2️⃣ Which pattern challenged your thinking the most?
> 
> 3️⃣ How will you combine these in future projects or workflows?
> 

✅ Learners submit reflection as a **Pattern Mindset Summary Report**.

---

## 🧩 **Part G – Instructor Extensions (Optional)**

| **Activity** | **Goal** |
| --- | --- |
| **Pattern Battle** | Two students pick different patterns for the same task and compare outputs. |
| **Blind QA Test** | Instructor removes labels; learners identify patterns used in given AI outputs. |
| **Pattern Portfolio** | Each student submits 5 reusable prompts demonstrating different patterns. |

---

## 🧾 **Part H – Bonus Challenge: “Pattern Stack Project”**

> Goal: Design one large composite prompt using at least 3 patterns.
> 

| **Requirement** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Patterns Used** | Must include at least one Persona, one Reasoning, and one Structure pattern. |
| **Topic** | Open (e.g., “Build a lesson on AI Safety” or “Generate marketing strategy”). |
| **Deliverables** | Final prompt + 3 intermediate versions showing evolution. |
| **Evaluation** | FHC scoring + Peer review commentary. |

✅ *Advanced Tip:* Encourage modular prompt syntax (e.g., `{Persona}`, `{Audience}`, `{Style}` tokens) for reusability in workflow automation.

---

## 🧠 **Part I – Summary Insight**

> Mastering Prompt Patterns is like learning musical theory — once you know the chords, you can compose anything.
> 
> 
> Each pattern in this module — Persona, Question Refinement, Cognitive Verifier, Audience Persona, Outline-First, and Style Transfer — is a *cognitive instrument.*
> 
> The true *Prompt Engineer* learns to play them **in harmony** — combining structure, tone, logic, and creativity into one coherent conversation with AI.
> 

---

✅ **Final Outcome:**

Upon completing Module 4, learners can **design, evaluate, and combine prompt patterns** to produce structured, controlled, and professional-grade AI outputs.

This is the bridge between prompting as an art — and prompting as engineering.
