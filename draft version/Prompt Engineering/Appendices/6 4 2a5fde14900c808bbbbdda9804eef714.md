## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Why Troubleshooting Matters**

Even expert prompt engineers face **hallucinations, drift, or inconsistent outputs**.

The difference between a beginner and a professional lies in one word — **diagnosis**.

Knowing *why* an output failed allows you to fix it *fast and systematically*.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of prompt troubleshooting like debugging code.
> 
> You’re not fixing “errors” — you’re adjusting **logic, clarity, and structure** to get consistent reasoning.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Prompt Troubleshooting:
> 
> 
> The structured process of identifying and correcting errors, ambiguities, or performance issues in AI-generated outputs to restore precision, reliability, and faithfulness.
>

### **2️⃣ Common Failure Modes**

| **Failure Mode** | **Symptom** | **Cause** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hallucination** | AI invents facts or sources. | Lack of retrieval grounding. |
| **Schema Drift** | Output format gradually changes. | Unclear structure or missing reminders. |
| **Context Overflow** | AI forgets earlier instructions. | Too many tokens or poor summarization. |
| **Ambiguous Prompting** | Model misinterprets request. | Vague or overloaded instructions. |
| **Tone Mismatch** | Output feels robotic or wrong. | Missing persona and tone anchors. |
| **Overconfidence** | AI states uncertain info as fact. | No verification loop or uncertainty handling. |
| **Response Cut-Off** | Output stops mid-answer. | Token limit or missing continuation cue. |

✅ *Rule:* Every failure is a *data point* for improvement.

---

### **3️⃣ The “FIXER Framework” for Prompt Diagnosis**

| **Step** | **Action** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **F – Find** | Identify the specific issue. | “What went wrong?” |
| **I – Inspect** | Examine the original prompt. | “Was it ambiguous or too long?” |
| **X – eXperiment** | Modify one element at a time. | Isolate cause (clarity, structure, tone). |
| **E – Evaluate** | Compare outputs for improvement. | Quantify differences. |
| **R – Reinforce** | Save the working version. | Build version-controlled library. |

✅ *FIXER = your repeatable debugging loop.*

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **1️⃣ Case Study: Hallucination Fix**

**Problem:**

ChatGPT “invented” an academic source while summarizing research.

**Diagnosis Steps (FIXER):**

1️⃣ **Find** → False citation detected.

2️⃣ **Inspect** → Prompt didn’t request source type or verification.

3️⃣ **eXperiment** → Add instruction:

```markdown
Cite only verified papers with title, author, and year.
If unsure, say “⚠️ Source unavailable.”

```

4️⃣ **Evaluate** → Output became transparent.

5️⃣ **Reinforce** → Save prompt as “Verified Summary v2.”

✅ *Lesson:* Add “epistemic humility” — allow AI to admit uncertainty.

---

### **2️⃣ Case Study: Schema Drift**

**Problem:**

JSON format responses start deviating after multiple iterations.

**Fix:**

```markdown
Always output valid JSON matching this schema:
{
  "summary": "",
  "key_points": [],
  "confidence": ""
}
If unsure, leave field blank.

```

✅ Add periodic **format reminders** every few messages.

LLMs have short-term memory — gentle repetition prevents drift.

---

### **3️⃣ Case Study: Context Overflow**

**Problem:**

AI forgets earlier details in long conversations.

**Fix Options:**

- Summarize and re-inject context manually:
    
    ```markdown
    Here’s a summary of our previous discussion:
    [insert compressed summary]
    Continue from here.
    
    ```
    
- Use **condensed memory prompts** like:
    
    > “Summarize key constraints before continuing.”
    > 

✅ *Key Insight:* LLMs don’t have memory; you must feed it back intelligently.

---

### **4️⃣ Case Study: Tone Mismatch**

**Problem:**

The AI output was too formal for a casual brand.

**Fix:**

```markdown
Rewrite in a friendly, conversational tone suitable for social media.
Avoid corporate jargon.

```

✅ *Lesson:* Tone control is a **prompt variable**, not post-editing.

---

### **5️⃣ Decision Tree: Troubleshooting by Symptom**

```
Start
 ├─ Is the response inaccurate? → Add verification or RAG step.
 ├─ Is format inconsistent? → Add schema + validation reminder.
 ├─ Is tone off? → Add persona + style anchor.
 ├─ Is output incomplete? → Add continuation cue or increase tokens.
 ├─ Is it biased? → Add fairness check sub-prompt.
 └─ Is it slow or repetitive? → Simplify or chunk large inputs.

```

✅ *Tip:* Treat this tree like a **“Prompt Doctor’s Chart.”**

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Recall a time your AI output was disappointing or incorrect.
> 
> 
> Identify the issue type (hallucination, drift, etc.).
> 
> How would you apply the **FIXER Framework** to improve it?
> 
> Optional: Document your troubleshooting steps as a “Prompt Log.”

### **Quick Quiz**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What does FIXER stand for? | Short Answer |
| 2 | Define schema drift in one sentence. | Short Answer |

### **Answer Key (Rebux Format)**

| **Q#** | **Answer** | **Explanation (Rebux)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Find, Inspect, eXperiment, Evaluate, Reinforce. | Stepwise troubleshooting process. |
| 2 | When the AI’s structured output format drifts from expected schema. | Fix with consistent reminders. |
| 3 | Summarize prior context and re-inject into new prompt. | Prevents forgetting and token loss. |
| 4 | Add a persona + tone anchor (e.g., “friendly, casual”). | Defines communication mood. |
| 5 | It builds credibility and reduces hallucination risk. | “Honest AI” principle for reliability. |

### **Mini Project – “Prompt Troubleshooting Logbook”**

> Goal: Build your own record of common prompt failures and solutions.
> 

| **Step** | **Instruction** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Create a Notion or spreadsheet template. | Columns: Issue / Symptom / Fix / Result. |
| 2️⃣ | Log 5+ prompt failures. | Example: “Drift in JSON schema.” |
| 3️⃣ | Apply FIXER method for each. | Diagnose, adjust, test. |
| 4️⃣ | Record before-after output. | Quantify improvement. |
| 5️⃣ | Identify recurring patterns. | Build troubleshooting heuristics. |

✅ *Advanced Option:* Turn your log into a public “Prompt Repair Guide” for others to learn from.
