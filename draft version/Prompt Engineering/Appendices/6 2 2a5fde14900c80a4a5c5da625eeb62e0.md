# 🧩 **1.6.2 Appendix B: Prompt Templates Library**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Why a Template Library Matters**

Every professional prompt engineer should maintain a personal library of **reliable prompt blueprints** — ready for immediate adaptation.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of these templates as your “AI instrument sheet music.”
> 
> You can improvise when needed, but structure ensures harmony and reproducibility.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Prompt Template:
> 
> 
> A reusable, parameterized text instruction designed to standardize model behavior across tasks, ensuring consistency, safety, and clarity.
>

### **2️⃣ Template Categories Overview**

| **Category** | **Purpose** | **Common Use Cases** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Safety Prompts** | Guide ethical responses & refusal logic. | Red-teaming, compliance, policy testing. |
| **Verification Prompts** | Check facts, sources, and accuracy. | Research validation, grounding checks. |
| **Evaluation Prompts** | Assess output quality and metrics. | Model scoring, feedback loops. |
| **Persona Prompts** | Establish AI role, tone, and expertise. | Teaching, coaching, storytelling. |
| **RAG Grounding Prompts** | Retrieve and use external data safely. | Knowledge-base querying, contextual generation. |

✅ Each type serves as a **functional building block** for real-world AI workflows.

## **Part B – Template Examples and Applications**

---

### **1️⃣ Safety Prompt Templates**

**Purpose:** Maintain ethical, policy-aligned behavior.

**Template 1 – General Safety Guard**

```markdown
Before answering, check whether the user’s request involves:
- Sensitive personal data
- Harmful or illegal actions
- Disallowed content (violence, hate, misinformation)

If any condition is met:
- Politely refuse
- Offer a safe educational or ethical alternative

```

✅ *Use Case:* Embedding in enterprise or education LLMs.

---

**Template 2 – Ethical Framing**

```markdown
Act as an ethical AI assistant.
For every question, assess:
1. Ethical risk (Low / Medium / High)
2. Mitigation suggestion
3. Transparent reasoning
Respond only if risk is “Low.”

```

✅ *Purpose:* Adds explainability to ethical filters.

---

### **2️⃣ Verification Prompt Templates**

**Purpose:** Ensure factual grounding and information integrity.

**Template 3 – Fact-Check Loop**

```markdown
Evaluate this statement:
“[Insert claim here]”
Perform:
1. Search for supporting and opposing evidence.
2. Assign confidence (0–100%).
3. Cite or explain source categories.

```

✅ *Use Case:* Academic or policy writing verification.

---

**Template 4 – Citation Validator**

```markdown
You are a citation reviewer.
Check if all listed sources:
- Match topic relevance
- Contain verifiable publication data
Return:
✅ Verified sources
⚠️ Suspicious or unverifiable ones

```

✅ *Purpose:* Ensures academic and journalistic transparency.

---

### **3️⃣ Evaluation Prompt Templates**

**Purpose:** Assess quality, coherence, or safety of outputs.

**Template 5 – Evaluation Matrix**

```markdown
Rate the following AI response across:
1. Faithfulness (1–5)
2. Helpfulness (1–5)
3. Clarity (1–5)
4. Tone (1–5)
Add 2 sentences of improvement feedback.

```

✅ *Use Case:* Internal model evaluation, human-AI feedback loops.

---

**Template 6 – Comparative Evaluation**

```markdown
Compare Response A and Response B.
Evaluate based on:
- Relevance
- Depth
- Factual accuracy
Select the better one and explain reasoning.

```

✅ *Purpose:* Fine-tuning prompt variants or LLM benchmarking.

---

### **4️⃣ Persona Prompt Templates**

**Purpose:** Establish role, behavior, and tone consistency.

**Template 7 – Expert Persona Setup**

```markdown
You are [ROLE].
Your audience is [AUDIENCE TYPE].
You always:
- Write with [TONE]
- Focus on [GOAL]
- Avoid [LIMITATIONS]
Start every response with a confident explanation.

```

**Example:**

> “You are a Senior Data Analyst explaining dashboards to non-technical managers.”
> 

✅ *Use Case:* Instructional design, corporate chatbots.

---

**Template 8 – Dual Persona Pattern**

```markdown
Agent A: Generate initial answer.
Agent B: Review A’s answer for clarity and ethics.
Return:
- A’s response
- B’s critique
- Final revised version

```

✅ *Purpose:* Implements Critic-Helper pattern without coding.

---

### **5️⃣ RAG Grounding Templates**

**Purpose:** Retrieve real-world data before generation.

**Template 9 – Basic RAG Retrieval**

```markdown
Fetch factual data from trusted sources before answering.
Always cite:
- Source title
- Publication year
- One supporting quote
Then, synthesize your own explanation using this evidence.

```

✅ *Use Case:* AI assistants handling research or Q&A tasks.

---

**Template 10 – Context-Aware RAG Synthesis**

```markdown
Given the query “[User Question]”
and retrieved data:
[Insert Text Snippet or JSON Here]

Step 1: Identify relevant facts.
Step 2: Synthesize a response using verified info only.
Step 3: Flag missing or uncertain details.

```

✅ *Purpose:* Prevents hallucination and over-generalization.

---

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Practice**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Which prompt category do you find most essential for your current work — Safety, Verification, Evaluation, Persona, or RAG?
> 
> 
> How could you combine two types (e.g., Persona + Evaluation) to make your own “hybrid” prompt pattern?
> 

---

### **Quick Quiz**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What’s the main purpose of safety prompts? | Short Answer |
| 2 | What is the Critic-Helper pattern used for? | Short Answer |
| 3 | How do RAG prompts improve factual accuracy? | Short Answer |
| 4 | Write one evaluation metric used in template examples. | Short Answer |
| 5 | Why should persona prompts define audience and tone? | Short Answer |

---

### **Answer Key (Rebux Format)**

| **Q#** | **Answer** | **Explanation (Rebux)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | To enforce ethical, policy-aligned behavior. | Ensures AI operates within safe parameters. |
| 2 | One AI generates, another critiques — improves quality and safety. | Encourages iterative improvement. |
| 3 | Retrieves verified info before generating content. | Reduces hallucination and bias. |
| 4 | Faithfulness, Helpfulness, Clarity, Tone. | Used in evaluation matrices. |
| 5 | Defines relevance and empathy of AI communication. | Aligns tone with user expectations. |
