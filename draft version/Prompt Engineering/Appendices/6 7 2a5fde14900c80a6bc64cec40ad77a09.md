# 🧩 **1.6.7 Appendix G: Capstone Templates & Docs Publishing Quickstart**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Why Documentation & Publishing Matter**

In the AI field, a prompt engineer’s skill is proven **not just by the prompts they write — but by the clarity of how they share and justify them.**

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of documentation as your “AI portfolio’s blueprint.”
> 
> It’s like a chef’s recipe book — not just showing what was cooked, but *how and why* it works.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Prompt Documentation:
> 
> 
> The structured presentation of AI projects, prompt systems, and evaluation results for transparency, collaboration, and career showcase purposes.
>

### **2️⃣ Core Elements of a Professional AI Project Doc**

| **Component** | **Purpose** | **Example Content** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PRD (Project Requirement Document)** | Defines goals, scope, features, and evaluation metrics. | “This assistant helps HR teams summarize candidate profiles.” |
| **Architecture Diagram** | Visualizes workflow or system design. | Flowchart showing “Input → Processing → Output.” |
| **Prompt Design Table** | Breaks down prompt components. | Role, Context, Constraints, Example Inputs. |
| **Evaluation Plan** | Defines success metrics and testing criteria. | Faithfulness ≥ 0.9, Bias < 0.1. |
| **Changelog / Version History** | Tracks improvements over time. | v1.1: Added safety pattern; v1.2: Updated schema format. |

✅ *Professional principle:* “If it isn’t documented, it doesn’t exist.”

---

### **3️⃣ The “DOCS Framework” for Project Publishing**

| **Step** | **Meaning** | **Example Action** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D – Define** | Establish purpose, audience, and outcomes. | “AI career assistant for students.” |
| **O – Organize** | Structure folders, data, and prompt templates. | Create `/data`, `/prompts`, `/eval` directories. |
| **C – Create** | Write PRD + build prompt flow diagrams. | Use draw.io or Mermaid syntax. |
| **S – Share** | Publish with GitHub Pages, MkDocs, or Notion. | Host public or portfolio-ready site. |

✅ *DOCS = Define → Organize → Create → Share.*

---

## **Part B – Application and Templates**

---

### **1️⃣ PRD (Project Requirement Document) Template**

**Project Title:**

> [Enter project name, e.g., “AI Resume Optimizer”]
> 

**1. Overview**

> Briefly describe what your project does and why it matters.
> 

**2. Objectives**

> 

**3. Features & Components**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Resume Parser | Extracts data fields. |
| Prompt Evaluator | Generates scoring summaries. |
| Feedback Loop | Improves based on user edits. |

**4. Evaluation Metrics**

| Metric | Target | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accuracy | ≥ 90% | Manual validation |

### **2️⃣ Architecture Diagram Template (Text-based)**

```
+---------------------+
| User Input (Resume) |
+----------+----------+
           |
           v
+---------------------+
| Prompt Processor    |
| (ChatGPT / LLM API) |
+----------+----------+
           |
           v
+---------------------+
| Output Formatter    |
| (JSON / Markdown)   |
+----------+----------+
           |
           v
+---------------------+
| Database / Notion   |
+---------------------+

```

✅ Use Mermaid in Markdown or tools like **draw.io** or **Whimsical** for visual diagrams.

---

### **3️⃣ Evaluation Plan Template**

| **Test Category** | **Goal** | **Prompt Example** | **Metric** | **Target** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Accuracy Test** | Validate data consistency | “Summarize resume into JSON schema.” | Schema integrity | 100% |
| **Bias Audit** | Detect demographic bias | “Give feedback without gender bias.” | Fairness score | ≥ 0.9 |
| **Faithfulness Check** | Ensure contextual grounding | “Use input data only, no assumptions.” | Faithfulness | ≥ 0.95 |
| **Usability Test** | Evaluate readability | “Rate clarity of feedback.” | Readability | ≥ 8/10 |

✅ *Purpose:* Quantify the qualitative — your results become replicable.

### **4️⃣ MkDocs / GitHub Pages Quickstart**

**1️⃣ Project Folder Structure**

```
/my-ai-project
│
├── docs/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── prd.md
│   ├── evaluation.md
│   ├── prompts/
│   └── assets/
│
├── mkdocs.yml
└── README.md

```

**2️⃣ Sample `mkdocs.yml` Configuration**

```yaml
site_name: AI Resume Optimizer
theme:
  name: material
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - PRD: prd.md
  - Evaluation: evaluation.md
  - Prompts: prompts/index.md

```

**3️⃣ Publishing Steps**

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs gh-deploy

```

✅ *Outcome:* A clean, public, portfolio-ready project website.

### **5️⃣ Documentation Best Practices**

| **Tip** | **Why It Matters** |
| --- | --- |
| Use short, instructive headings. | Improves readability. |
| Include at least one diagram per section. | Enhances clarity. |
| Version your prompts (v1, v2...). | Shows iterative improvement. |
| Add changelog and contributors. | Builds professional transparency. |
| Link evaluations and results clearly. | Demonstrates measurable impact. |

✅ *Professionalism = Structure + Transparency.*
