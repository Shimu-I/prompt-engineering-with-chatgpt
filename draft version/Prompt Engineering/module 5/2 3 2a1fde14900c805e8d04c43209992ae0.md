# 🧩 **1.3.2.3 ReAct Pattern (Reason + Act)**

---

### **Part A – Concept Foundations**

### **1️⃣ What Is the ReAct Pattern?**

The **ReAct Pattern** stands for **Reason + Act.**

It’s a prompting technique where the model alternates between **thinking (reasoning)** and **acting (performing tasks or retrieving information)** in structured steps.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Imagine a detective solving a case:
> 
> - 🧩 Step 1: Think — “Who had access to the vault?”
> - 🔍 Step 2: Act — “Check the surveillance footage.”
> - 🧩 Step 3: Think — “The suspect was there at 9:00 PM.”
> - 🔍 Step 4: Act — “Cross-check their alibi.”
> 
> The detective **reasons and acts in loops** — just like ReAct-enabled AI.
> 

✅ ReAct turns static reasoning (like Chain-of-Thought) into **interactive, tool-using reasoning**.

---

### **2️⃣ Why ReAct Is Powerful**

Traditional reasoning (like CoT) is introspective — the model *thinks*, then *answers*.

But ReAct goes further — it *thinks, performs an action, checks the result,* and then *continues reasoning*.

It enables **multi-step, dynamic decision-making.**

| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** | **ReAct Pattern** |
| --- | --- |
| Think → Answer | Think → Act → Observe → Reason → Answer |
| Internal reasoning only | External actions allowed (API calls, retrievals) |
| One pass | Multi-pass loop |
| Static | Interactive & tool-integrated |

✅ The ReAct pattern is the foundation for **AI agents**, **retrieval-augmented systems**, and **automated workflows.**

---

### **3️⃣ The Core Structure of ReAct**

| **Step** | **Phase** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | **Thought (Reason)** | The model explains what it’s thinking or deciding. | “I need to find the population of Japan.” |
| 2️⃣ | **Action** | The model executes a task (tool call, retrieval, calculation). | “Searching Wikipedia for ‘population of Japan.’” |
| 3️⃣ | **Observation** | The model reads and interprets results. | “Wikipedia says 125 million.” |
| 4️⃣ | **Conclusion** | The model outputs the final answer. | “Therefore, Japan’s population is about 125 million.” |

> **Thought → Action → Observation → Answer**

### **4️⃣ Cognitive Purpose of ReAct**

ReAct integrates **two reasoning systems**:

1. **System 1:** Fast, intuitive, pattern-based generation.
2. **System 2:** Slow, logical, tool-assisted reasoning.

By combining both, ReAct balances **efficiency and accuracy** — essential for multi-tool AI environments.

---

### **5️⃣ When to Use ReAct**

| **Use Case** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| **Web or API-Connected Models** | For retrieval, lookup, or live data processing. |
| **Data Analysis Tasks** | Use Reason → Act loops for verification. |
| **Research Agents** | Stepwise retrieval and summarization. |
| **Debugging / QA Systems** | Logical check → Code execution → Correction. |
| **Automations** | Trigger structured actions after logical planning. |

> 💡 ReAct = “Think before doing, verify after doing.”

### **Part B – Application and Examples**

### **Example 1 – Basic ReAct Pattern**

**Prompt:**

```
You are an AI assistant that follows this loop:
Thought: Analyze the question logically.
Action: Perform the necessary lookup or calculation.
Observation: Interpret the result.
Final Answer: Conclude based on evidence.

Question: What is the GDP of France?

```

**AI Output:**

> Thought: I should check the GDP data for France.
> 
> 
> Action: Searching for France GDP.
> 
> Observation: Found latest GDP is $3.05 trillion (2023).
> 
> Final Answer: The GDP of France is approximately $3 trillion USD.
> 

✅ Logical → Operational → Verified → Answered.

---

### **Example 2 – ReAct for Code Execution**

```
Question: What is the average of these numbers [3, 5, 7, 9]?

Thought: I need to calculate the average.
Action: (Run calculation) (3+5+7+9)/4 = 6.
Observation: The result is 6.
Final Answer: The average is 6.

```

✅ Combines reasoning + computation — ideal for data or math automation.

---

### **Example 3 – Research Workflow**

**Prompt:**

```
Task: Identify the most cited paper on GPT models.

Thought: Search for “most cited GPT research paper.”
Action: Query Google Scholar.
Observation: Found “Language Models are Few-Shot Learners” (Brown et al., 2020).
Final Answer: The most cited GPT paper is Brown et al., 2020.

```

✅ Integrates retrieval (Act) with analysis (Reason).

---

### **Example 4 – Troubleshooting Scenario**

```
Task: My Python script crashes with ‘ValueError: cannot convert string to int.’
Thought: Identify the cause of the error.
Action: Analyze code to find data type issues.
Observation: Found input() not wrapped in int().
Final Answer: Fix by converting user input to int with int(input()).

```

✅ AI acts as a diagnostic agent — reasoning + code analysis combined.

---

### **Example 5 – Multi-Step ReAct Loop (Advanced)**

```
Thought 1: I need to find the weather in Tokyo.
Action 1: Query weather API.
Observation 1: Current temperature is 22°C.
Thought 2: I need to convert that to Fahrenheit.
Action 2: (Calculate) 22 × 9/5 + 32 = 71.6°F.
Observation 2: Conversion successful.
Final Answer: Tokyo’s temperature is 71.6°F.

```

✅ Sequential reasoning-action loop = autonomous task completion.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Choose a task needing reasoning + data. | “Find today’s top AI news.” |
| 2️⃣ | Write the loop structure explicitly. | Thought → Action → Observation → Answer. |
| 3️⃣ | Integrate one “Act” step (lookup, calculation, or file read). | “Search AI headlines.” |
| 4️⃣ | Simulate Observation and adjust reasoning. | “Observation: Found OpenAI releases new model.” |
