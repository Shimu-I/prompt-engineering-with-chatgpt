# 🧩 **1.3.2.9 Exam Section — Application + Code Challenge**

---

## 🧠 **Part A – Overview**

### **Purpose of This Exam**

This final section assesses your ability to:

- Combine **reasoning patterns** (CoT, ReAct, ToT)
- Apply **few-shot techniques** to real problems
- Build **analytical and self-correcting prompts**
- Evaluate outputs using **FHC metrics**

> 🧩 Analogy:
>

## ⚙️ **Part C – Pattern Matching Challenge (Applied Reasoning)**

> Identify the reasoning pattern(s) used or required in each case:
> 

| **Scenario** | **Best Pattern(s)** | **Why** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ Model generates random answers for same input. | Self-Consistency / Majority Voting | Improves reliability. |
| 2️⃣ AI produces long irrelevant content. | Question Refinement + Constraints | Tightens scope. |
| 3️⃣ You need reasoning + web search integration. | ReAct Pattern | Combines reasoning + action. |
| 4️⃣ You want multiple hypothesis generation. | Tree-of-Thought (ToT) | Branching reasoning. |
| 5️⃣ AI gives confident but wrong data. | Reflection + Critic-Helper | Self-verification pass. |
| 6️⃣ Generate 3 example-based solutions for a dataset. | Few-Shot Prompting | Demonstration-based learning. |
| 7️⃣ You want iterative debugging of Python code. | CoT + Reflection | Logical + self-fixing steps. |
| 8️⃣ AI explains logic but skips verification. | Cognitive Verifier Pattern | Adds accuracy layer. |
| 9️⃣ Combine empathy + structured output. | Persona + Outline Pattern | Balanced voice + format. |
| 🔟 Evaluate responses for factual integrity. | Faithfulness (FHC) Metric | Evaluation consistency. |

✅ These scenarios assess **pattern fluency** and **diagnostic accuracy**.

## 💻 **Part D – Code Challenge: Build a Reasoning-Driven AI Task**

### **Challenge Objective**

Create a **Few-Shot + Chain-of-Thought + Reflection** prompt that performs **data analysis or code reasoning** with reliability and explainability.

---

### **Problem Statement**

> Design a prompt that analyzes a small dataset or code snippet step-by-step, verifies its logic, and outputs the result in JSON format.
> 

**Example Input:**

```
Data: [12, 15, 20, 23, 25, 30]
Task: Calculate average, detect outliers, and explain reasoning.

```

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

| **Stage** | **Prompt Component** | **Example Implementation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Instruction | “You are a data analyst. Think step-by-step to calculate insights.” |
| 2️⃣ | Few-Shot Example | “Example: [10, 20, 30] → avg=20, outlier=None, reason: evenly spaced.” |
| 3️⃣ | Reasoning (CoT) | “First compute average, then evaluate deviation per point.” |
| 4️⃣ | Reflection Layer | “Now verify your logic. Correct if any step seems inconsistent.” |
| 5️⃣ | Output Schema | “Return JSON: {average, outliers, reasoning}” |

---

### **Expected AI Output**

```json
{
  "average": 20.8,
  "outliers": [],
  "reasoning": "Each value falls within 2 standard deviations, indicating stable data."
}

```

✅ **Why This Works:**

It merges **Few-Shot (pattern learning)** + **CoT (step-by-step logic)** + **Reflection (error correction)** — the trifecta of intelligent prompting.

---

### **Bonus Challenge: ReAct-Enhanced Version**

Add a “tool” action layer — e.g., instruct the model to *simulate running a calculation* or *fetch reference data*:

```
Thought: I need to calculate variance.
Action: Compute variance of dataset.
Observation: Variance = 40.2.
Answer: No significant outliers found.

```

✅ Simulates agent-like reasoning — perfect for **advanced engineering tasks**.

## 🧩 **Part E – Evaluation Rubric**

| **Dimension** | **Points** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Concept Mastery | 20 | Demonstrates understanding of all major reasoning patterns. |
| Application Design | 20 | Uses multi-pattern integration logically. |
| Code Implementation | 20 | Builds working Few-Shot + CoT prompt with structured logic. |
| Reflection & Verification | 20 | Adds self-correction or Critic-Helper layer. |
| Evaluation Insight | 20 | Applies metrics (FHC or custom). |
| **Total** | **100 pts** |  |

✅ *Instructor/peer review can be conducted using the same rubric or self-assessment.*

---

## 🧩 **Part F – Reflection Section**

> Reflect on your own evolution through Module 5:
> 
> 
> 1️⃣ Which reasoning technique (CoT, ReAct, ToT, or Reflection) changed how you design prompts?
> 
> 2️⃣ How has your understanding of “teaching AI with examples” evolved?
> 
> 3️⃣ Describe one improvement you’ll implement in your future prompt workflows.
> 

✅ Encourage a **200-word written reflection** or **self-review recording** as part of assessment.

## 🧾 **Part G – Instructor Extensions (Optional)**

| **Activity** | **Goal** |
| --- | --- |
| **Peer Pattern Review** | Students swap and critique each other’s prompt logic. |
| **Prompt Debugging Challenge** | Identify and fix poor reasoning prompts. |
| **Automated Scoring Script** | Use FHC + token cost metrics to auto-score submissions. |

---

## ✅ **Part H – Final Summary Insight**

> Module 5 represents the transition from prompting as input-output to prompting as system design.
> 
> 
> You now understand:
> 
> - How Few-Shot creates demonstration-based intelligence.
> - How CoT and ToT structure AI reasoning.
> - How ReAct and Critic-Helper bring verification and action.
> - And how metrics and reflection sustain continuous improvement.
> 
> 💡 *Final Thought:*
> 
> “Prompt Engineering isn’t about talking to AI — it’s about teaching it how to think.”
