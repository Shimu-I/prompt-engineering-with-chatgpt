# 🧩 **1.3.2.6 Practice: Few-Shot Prompt for Data Analysis**

---

## 🧠 **Part A – Concept Foundations**

### **1️⃣ Why Data Analysis with Few-Shot Prompts Matters**

Most LLMs, including ChatGPT’s **Advanced Data Analysis (ADA)** mode, can perform powerful data reasoning when guided by a clear structure.

However, without context or examples, they often misinterpret tables, formulas, or correlations.

**Few-shot prompting** solves this by providing *structured demonstrations* that teach the model **how to think analytically** before it’s asked to act.

> 🧩 Analogy:
> 
> 
> You wouldn’t expect a new analyst to understand your company’s KPIs without showing previous reports.
> 
> Similarly, the AI “learns the language of your data” through examples.
> 

✅ **Goal:** Turn natural language prompts into consistent analytical logic.

---

### **2️⃣ The Analytical Few-Shot Pattern**

Few-shot prompting for data analysis typically follows this **Input → Analysis → Output** pattern with example-driven reasoning.

| **Step** | **Component** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | **Instruction** | Define the analytical goal. | “Analyze the CSV for trends.” |
| 2️⃣ | **Example Inputs** | Provide sample datasets. | “Month: Jan, Sales: 2000…” |
| 3️⃣ | **Example Outputs** | Show expected insight format. | “Trend: Growth of 10% MoM.” |
| 4️⃣ | **New Data** | Add real test data. | “Month: May, Sales: 4000…” |
| 5️⃣ | **Task Query** | Ask for analysis. | “Identify trend and projection.” |

✅ The model **infers the logic** of how to analyze from the examples.

---

### **3️⃣ When to Use Few-Shot Analysis**

| **Scenario** | **Goal** | **Few-Shot Value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CSV/JSON data** | Trend extraction | Learns correct syntax for parsing |
| **Business metrics** | KPI summarization | Replicates analytic tone |
| **Scientific data** | Pattern identification | Ensures domain-specific reasoning |
| **Survey text** | Sentiment classification | Consistent scoring logic |
| **Logs or reports** | Error analysis | Structured debugging reasoning |

✅ *Few-Shot works best when the data logic or output format must stay consistent across multiple tasks.*

---

### **4️⃣ Best Practices for Few-Shot Data Prompts**

| **Rule** | **Why It Matters** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use realistic sample data | Teaches proper structure | “Column names must match actual data.” |
| Include interpretation in examples | Demonstrates reasoning | “Sales increased by 5% → upward trend.” |
| Keep examples concise | Saves context tokens | Use small representative samples. |
| Always define output schema | Enforces format consistency | “Output JSON: {trend, prediction, note}” |
| Test transfer to unseen data | Ensures generalization | New dataset, same analysis style. |

✅ Few-shot examples = *mini training dataset* embedded in your prompt.

## ⚙️ **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Simple Trend Analysis**

**Prompt:**

```
You are a data analyst. Learn from the following examples and analyze new data.

Example 1:
Input:
Month | Sales
Jan | 2000
Feb | 2400
Mar | 2700
Output:
Trend: Upward trend of 35% overall.

Example 2:
Input:
Month | Sales
Apr | 2700
May | 2500
Jun | 2300
Output:
Trend: Downward trend of 15%.

Now analyze:
Month | Sales
Jul | 2300
Aug | 2600
Sep | 2900

```

✅ **Expected Output:**

> Trend: Upward trend of 26% recovery after earlier dip.
> 

---

### **Example 2 – Classification Analysis (Sentiment)**

**Prompt:**

```
Example 1:
Input: "The service was amazing!"
Output: Positive

Example 2:
Input: "The product broke on day one."
Output: Negative

Now classify:
Input: "The delivery was slow, but the product is great."

```

✅ Output → *Mixed / Neutral-positive sentiment.*

---

### **Example 3 – KPI Performance Summary**

```
Instruction: Analyze quarterly data for performance.

Example 1:
Input:
Q1 Revenue: $1.2M
Q2 Revenue: $1.8M
Output:
Revenue increased by 50% QoQ, strong growth.

Now analyze:
Q3 Revenue: $1.9M
Q4 Revenue: $1.5M

```

✅ Output:

> Revenue decreased by ~21%, potential seasonal drop.
> 

---

### **Example 4 – Categorical Data Reasoning**

```
Instruction: Summarize category distribution.

Example 1:
Input:
Electronics: 30%
Clothing: 50%
Toys: 20%
Output:
Clothing is dominant, Electronics second.

Now analyze:
Electronics: 45%
Clothing: 35%
Toys: 20%

```

✅ Output:

> Electronics leads the category mix, rising from 30% to 45%.
> 

---

### **Example 5 – JSON Schema Few-Shot**

```
Example 1:
Input: {"Jan": 200, "Feb": 250, "Mar": 275}
Output: {"trend": "upward", "growth_rate": 37.5, "comment": "strong Q1"}

Example 2:
Input: {"Apr": 275, "May": 250, "Jun": 200}
Output: {"trend": "downward", "growth_rate": -27.3, "comment": "sales decline"}

New Data:
{"Jul": 200, "Aug": 240, "Sep": 280}

```

✅ Output:

`{"trend": "upward", "growth_rate": 40, "comment": "steady recovery"}`
