# 🧩 **1.4.2.7 Automation Jobs (Batch Runs, CSV/JSON I/O)**

*(Scaling ADA Workflows for Continuous, Autonomous Execution)*

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ What Are Automation Jobs in ADA?**

**Automation Jobs** are workflows that run **repetitive ADA tasks automatically** — like analyzing new data each day, generating summaries for multiple files, or exporting standardized reports.

They combine **batch execution**, **loop-based data processing**, and **structured I/O handling** inside ADA’s secure Python sandbox.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Imagine having a team of tireless data analysts who never forget a step.
> 
> Automation Jobs let ADA perform recurring analyses, reporting, and data formatting — on command or schedule.
> 

✅ **Goal:**

Eliminate manual repetition and make ADA systems **self-operating data assistants**.

---

### **2️⃣ Why Automation Matters**

| **Benefit** | **Impact** |
| --- | --- |
| ⏱ **Saves time** | Automates daily or weekly reporting tasks. |
| 📦 **Batch consistency** | Ensures identical processing steps across datasets. |
| 🧮 **Error reduction** | Removes human variation in data handling. |
| 📊 **Scalability** | Processes dozens of files in one workflow. |
| 🔁 **Reproducibility** | Produces identical results across runs. |

✅ Automation transforms ADA from an *interactive tool* into a *data operations system.*

---

### **3️⃣ ADA’s Input/Output (I/O) Capabilities**

| **I/O Type** | **Operation** | **Example Prompt / Task** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CSV I/O** | Read/write tabular data | “Read sales.csv, output clean_sales.csv.” |
| **JSON I/O** | Read/write structured data | “Convert report results into JSON format.” |
| **ZIP / Folder I/O** | Batch process files | “Unzip data.zip and merge all CSVs.” |
| **PDF / Excel Export** | Create reports | “Export analysis to quarterly_report.pdf.” |
| **Automation Loop** | Iterate tasks | “Run for all files in directory and summarize totals.” |

✅ ADA can also generate log files or structured summaries to **track performance over time**.

---

### **4️⃣ Key Automation Patterns**

| **Pattern** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Batch Loop Pattern** | Repeats same analysis on multiple files. | “For each file in folder, summarize data.” |
| **Scheduled Run Pattern** | Simulates recurring updates. | “Every Monday, generate performance report.” |
| **Chain Pattern** | Connects multiple task steps. | “Clean → Analyze → Visualize → Export.” |
| **Conditional Pattern** | Adds logic checks in workflow. | “If missing data > 10%, skip file.” |
| **Logging Pattern** | Records outputs and errors. | “Write summary log for all runs.” |

> 💡 Pro Insight:
> 
> 
> Use structured file names (e.g., `data_2025_01.csv`) to make automation more predictable and traceable.

### **5️⃣ Design Principles for Reliable Automation**

| **Principle** | **What It Ensures** |
| --- | --- |
| **Determinism** | Same input → same output |
| **Transparency** | Every run logged or recorded |
| **Recoverability** | Errors don’t crash the system |
| **Safety Checks** | Prevents processing bad files |
| **Parameterization** | Easy to adjust variables like date or thresholds |

✅ Well-designed automation is **auditable, safe, and efficient** — exactly like professional data pipelines.

---

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Multi-File Batch Summary**

```
Prompt:
"Upload all monthly_sales_*.csv files.
For each file:
1. Read and clean data.
2. Calculate total revenue.
3. Append result to summary table.
Export final summary as batch_report.csv."

```

✅ ADA loops through files and creates one consolidated report.

---

### **Example 2 – JSON Log Generator**

```
Prompt:
"For each dataset in this folder, compute KPIs and store results in a JSON log:
[{'file':'name.csv', 'revenue':..., 'growth':...}]"

```

✅ Produces a structured JSON file, useful for audits or version control.

---

### **Example 3 – Automated Daily Report Export**

```
Prompt:
"Combine all sales files uploaded today,
generate a summary chart, and export PDF named 'daily_report_[date].pdf'."

```

✅ ADA dynamically names and saves output for each run.

---

### **Example 4 – Error Handling in Batch Jobs**

```
Prompt:
"For each file:
- Try to read as CSV.
- If format invalid, skip and log filename to errors.txt.
- Continue with next file."

```

✅ Demonstrates fault-tolerant automation — critical for real-world batch pipelines.

---

### **Example 5 – CSV-to-JSON Conversion Job**

```
Prompt:
"Convert all uploaded .csv files into .json format.
Store outputs in compressed ZIP file for download."

```

✅ ADA executes a **data format conversion batch job**, exporting a unified output package.

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think about your current workflows — where do repetitive data tasks occur (e.g., daily metrics, report merging, file conversion)?
> 
> 
> How could ADA automation jobs replace manual repetition while maintaining traceability and safety?

| **Step** | **Instruction** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Upload multiple datasets. | “Upload sales_jan.csv, sales_feb.csv…” |
| 2️⃣ | Loop through each file. | “For each, calculate total sales.” |
| 3️⃣ | Log results. | “Store as JSON summary.” |
| 4️⃣ | Export combined file. | “Save summary.csv and summary.json.” |
| 5️⃣ | Add error capture. | “If file unreadable, write to errors.txt.” |

✅ *Advanced Option:* Add **time-based naming or API triggers**, e.g., `summary_2025_11_04.csv`.
