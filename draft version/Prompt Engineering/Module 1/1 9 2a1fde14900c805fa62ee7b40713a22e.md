### **Part C – Section 2: Short Answer Questions**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Model Answer Summary** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | Define prompt engineering in one sentence. | The structured design of AI inputs to produce controlled, purposeful outputs. |
| 12 | List the three essential parts of a prompt. | Role / Task / Format. |
| 13 | What does the “attention” mechanism allow LLMs to do? | Identify which tokens influence each other most, enabling contextual reasoning. |
| 14 | Explain why LLMs sometimes hallucinate. | They predict plausible text without verifying truth; no direct database or awareness. |
| 15 | What’s the benefit of using a persona in prompts? | Ensures consistent tone and domain-specific style in output. |
| 16 | Name two open-source LLM families. | LLaMA and Mistral (or Falcon, Gemma etc.). |
| 17 | What is the AI Interaction Loop used for? | Iteratively refining AI responses through feedback and prompt adjustment. |
| 18 | How can you reduce creativity drift in technical answers? | Lower temperature and add “be precise and factual” instruction. |
| 19 | Describe a real-world use case for ChatGPT tools. | ADA for data analysis reports from CSV files; DALL·E for visual design. |
| 20 | Why is understanding limits important for trustworthy AI use? | Prevents over-reliance, enables safe and ethical prompt design. |

### **Instructions**

1. **Choose a Real-World Scenario:**
    
    (e.g., education, marketing, coding, research, storytelling).
    
2. **Write an initial prompt** that requests an AI output for that scenario.
3. **Run it in ChatGPT or API.** Observe the response.
4. **Evaluate it** for clarity, accuracy, tone, and usefulness.
5. **Refine your prompt** using the 3C Framework (Clarity / Context / Constraints).
6. **Compare before-and-after outputs.** Describe the improvement.
