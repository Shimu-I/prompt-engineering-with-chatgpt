---

## 🧩 **1.1.1.1 What AI Can and Cannot Do**

---

### **Part A – Concept Foundations**

**Definition:**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of building systems that **perceive, reason, and act** in ways that resemble human cognition — but through mathematical pattern recognition rather than consciousness.

> 🧠 Analogy: Think of AI as an autopilot system — it keeps the plane steady and follows data patterns, but it doesn’t understand why you’re flying.
> 

---

### **Capabilities (AI CAN)**

| **Domain** | **Example Task** | **Prompt Engineer Opportunity** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Language Generation** | Writing, summarizing, translating | Design tone, persona, structure |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Detecting trends in data | Use structured prompts for analysis |
| **Prediction & Reasoning** | Forecasting, classification | Apply step-by-step reasoning prompts |
| **Creativity & Design** | Images, poetry, code | Control style, constraints, audience |
| **Automation** | Repetitive digital tasks | Chain prompts and tools |

---

### **Limitations (AI CANNOT)**

| **Category** | **Why It Matters** | **Prompting Implication** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **True Understanding** | Lacks consciousness or intent | Must specify context explicitly |
| **Real-Time Awareness** | No live perception unless tool-enabled | Add time-based or update checks |
| **Emotional Judgment** | Mimics empathy, doesn’t feel it | Human review for sensitivity tasks |
| **Moral Reasoning** | No innate ethics | Add explicit guardrails |
| **Original Knowledge** | Works only from patterns in data | Verify facts externally |

> ⚙️ Insight: AI ≠ omniscience. It’s a mirror of human knowledge, not a mind.
> 

---

### **Part B – Application and Examples**

- **Example 1:** AI can draft emails, but it cannot sense when an apology *feels sincere*.
- **Example 2:** It can design a resume layout, but not decide if it “fits” your dream job without criteria.
- **Example 3:** It can predict language fluently, but not *mean* anything it says.

✅ Prompt Engineer’s Goal: Use human insight + AI speed.

---

### **Part C – Reflection and Practice**

> Reflect: Which daily tasks in your life could AI amplify — and which require distinctly human judgment?
> 

| **Task** | **AI Assist?** | **Human Lead?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drafting emails | ✅ |  |
| Evaluating a student’s emotion |  | ✅ |
| Data summaries | ✅ |  |
| Ethical decision |  | ✅ |

## ⚙️ **1.1.1.2 Prompt vs Programming**

---

### **Part A – Concept Foundations**

**Definition:**

**Prompting** is giving *natural-language instructions* to AI models.

**Programming** is writing *formal code* that computers execute literally.

> 💬 Analogy: Prompting = conversation with a polyglot assistant.
> 
> 
> Programming = *issuing commands to a robot that obeys exact syntax*.
> 

---

### **Comparison Table**

| **Aspect** | **Prompting** | **Programming** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Language** | Human language | Coding syntax |
| **Error Tolerance** | Flexible interpretation | Strict syntax rules |
| **Goal** | Generate ideas / content | Execute instructions |
| **Iteration Speed** | Seconds – real time | Compile / debug cycles |
| **Accessibility** | No code skills required | Requires technical training |

---

### **Part B – Application and Examples**

### **Example Prompt vs Program**

| **Prompt** | **Equivalent Program (Simplified)** |
| --- | --- |
| “Write a 100-word summary of the French Revolution.” | `summary = summarize(text, length=100)` |
| “Generate five business names for a coffee brand.” | `brand_names = ai.generate_names(category="coffee", n=5)` |

✅ Both achieve a goal; prompting is just the *faster creative interface.*

---

### **Part C – Reflection and Practice**

> “When does a prompt become a program?”
> 
> 
> When it contains **clear instructions, structure, and conditional logic**.
> 

🧩 **Mini Task:** Turn this prompt into a structured “prompt-program”:

> “Create three social media posts for a fitness app in friendly tone, each ending with a call to action.”
>

## 💬 **1.1.1.3 ChatGPT as a Collaborator**

---

### **Part A – Concept Foundations**

ChatGPT is not a tool to *command* but a partner to *collaborate* with.

It extends your thinking capacity through dialogue, iteration, and feedback.

> 🧠 Analogy: Imagine pair-programming or co-writing with an assistant who never gets tired — but needs guidance.
> 

---

### **Modes of Collaboration**

| **Mode** | **Use Case** | **Prompt Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Brainstorming** | Generate ideas fast | “List creative taglines for a mental health app.” |
| **Research Assistant** | Summarize / compare sources | “Summarize key arguments for and against remote work.” |
| **Reviewer** | Audit / improve writing | “Act as an editor and improve flow and tone.” |
| **Simulator** | Role-play situations | “Pretend to be an interviewer for a data-science job.” |

---

### **Part B – Application and Examples**

1️⃣ **Prompt Chain:** Idea → Outline → Draft → Critique → Refine.

2️⃣ Use ChatGPT for “reflection on output”: ask *“What did you miss?”*

3️⃣ Combine roles: *writer + editor + coach.*

✅ Result: Dynamic dialogue = higher quality output per iteration.

---

### **Part C – Reflection and Practice**

> Try This: Ask ChatGPT to review something you’ve already written.
> 
> 
> Then ask it to explain its own suggestions.
> 
> Observe how the conversation becomes a feedback loop — that’s collaboration in action.
>

## ⚖️ **1.1.1.4 Responsible Use and Misuse Awareness**

---

### **Part A – Concept Foundations**

**Responsible AI Use** means applying AI tools ethically and safely to benefit humans without causing harm.

Every prompt engineer is also a **steward of impact**.

> 💬 Analogy: Using AI is like driving a powerful car — you must know the speed limits and rules before you enjoy the ride.
> 

---

### **Common Misuses**

| **Misuse** | **Impact** | **Preventive Prompting Tactic** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copy-pasting AI output as original | Plagiarism | Add “Cite sources and rephrase in my own voice.” |
| Fabricating facts / quotes | Misinformation | Add “If uncertain, state it clearly.” |
| Deepfake or deceptive content | Ethical risk | Avoid identity simulation requests. |
| Using AI for harassment / spam | Harmful intent | Stay within policy and respect boundaries. |

---

### **Ethical Framework: A.I.M.**

| **A** – **Accountability** | You own the outputs you use. |

| **I** – **Integrity** | Always represent AI content truthfully. |

| **M** – **Mindfulness** | Consider impact on others and society. |

---

### **Part B – Application and Examples**

- Add disclaimers for AI-generated content.
- Verify AI information with external sources.
- Avoid automating decisions that affect human rights or health.

✅ Prompt Engineer’s Mantra: *“Design for benefit, not just efficiency.”*

---

### **Part C – Reflection and Practice**

> Think about a moment when AI saved you time.
> 
> 
> Did you verify its output or share it blindly?
> 
> Responsible AI means *reflect before you use.*
> 

---

---

## 🛠️ **1.1.1.5 Practice – “My Daily Task Prompt”**

---

### **Part A – Concept Foundations**

Goal: Use AI to automate a simple repetitive task in your day (e.g., summarizing notes, drafting emails, planning meals).

> 🧩 Analogy: This is your “Hello World” moment for prompt engineering.
> 
> 
> Instead of printing text, you’ll print *efficiency.*
> 

---

### **Part B – Exercise Steps**

| **Step** | **Instruction** | **Example Input/Output** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Identify one daily task | “Organize my meeting notes.” |
| 2 | Write a simple prompt | “Summarize these meeting notes into 3 key takeaways and action items.” |
| 3 | Run and observe output | ✅ Structured summary with bullets |
| 4 | Refine for clarity | Add: “Use positive tone and highlight deadlines.” |
| 5 | Save final version | This becomes your personal productivity prompt. |

---

### **Part C – Reflection and Evaluation**

> How did it change your workflow?
> 
> 
> Which wording improved output most?
> 
> Would you trust the AI’s version in real use?
> 

✅ Document before/after versions to see your growth as a prompt designer.
