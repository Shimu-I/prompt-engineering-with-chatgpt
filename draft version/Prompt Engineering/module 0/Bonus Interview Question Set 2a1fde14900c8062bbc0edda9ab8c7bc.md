## 🧩 **Answer Key & Rubric**

| **Q#** | **Model Answer Summary** | **Evaluation Notes (Max 5 pts each)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | AI is the simulation of human cognitive processes (thinking, learning, decision-making) by machines. | Clarity and simplicity |
| 2 | AI = broad concept of machine intelligence; ML = subset focused on learning from data. | Distinction accuracy |
| 3 | Perception (seeing/hearing), Reasoning (decision-making), and Generation (creating new data). | Completeness |
| 4 | AI should augment human skill, not replace judgment or creativity. | Conceptual understanding |
| 5 | It creates new outputs (text, image, sound) based on learned patterns. | Correctness |
| 6 | Both use structured inputs to get specific outputs, but prompting uses natural language instead of code. | Analogy clarity |
| 7 | Anyone can use it without coding skills — accessible interface. | Practical awareness |
| 8 | Examples: writing emails, summarizing notes, generating reports. | Real-world relevance |
| 9 | Boosts creativity, organization, and time management through automation. | Insightful application |
| 10 | Legal, medical, or safety-critical decisions. | Ethical reasoning |
| 11 | Designing, using, and evaluating AI with fairness, safety, and accountability in mind. | Concept accuracy |
| 12 | Using AI for misinformation, plagiarism, or harmful manipulation. | Awareness of misuse |
| 13 | Transparency builds trust and accountability. | Ethical logic |
| 14 | Bias = unfair influence in AI outputs; minimize via balanced data and neutral prompts. | Mitigation awareness |
| 15 | Overuse weakens independent thought; users should reflect and verify. | Reflective awareness |
| 16 | ChatGPT supports brainstorming, clarification, and personalized tutoring. | Practical example |
| 17 | Give feedback like: “Clarify this section” or “Add more examples.” | Constructive tone |
| 18 | It identifies and predicts patterns statistically, not consciously. | Concept depth |
| 19 | Human creativity + AI efficiency = better outcomes (e.g., design, writing). | Collaboration clarity |
| 20 | Move from fear/overtrust to curiosity and co-creation. | Growth mindset |
