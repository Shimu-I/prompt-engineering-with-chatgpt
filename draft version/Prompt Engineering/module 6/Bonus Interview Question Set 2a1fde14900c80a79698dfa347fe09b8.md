## 🧠 **Section B – Applied Scenarios (Reasoning & Design)**

**11️⃣** You’re building a storytelling prompt that makes the AI act like a detective solving a case.

Which pattern would you use and why?

**12️⃣** You need to ensure that a report generation system follows an exact JSON format every time.

Which pattern guarantees this consistency?

**13️⃣** The AI keeps misinterpreting your domain-specific instructions.

How could Meta-Language prompting fix this?

**14️⃣** You want an AI to act like a “teacher,” explaining each step, asking questions, and evaluating a learner’s response.

Which pattern combination is best suited?

**15️⃣** You have 5 different prompt versions solving the same problem.

How would you decide which approach is the most effective?

**16️⃣** You want to build a customer-support bot that answers only from verified documents.

Which pattern or architecture would you use?

**17️⃣** Your creative prompt produces unsafe or sensitive outputs.

How can you modify the design using Safety-Aware principles?

**18️⃣** You’re training multiple LLMs to play roles (CEO, Analyst, Engineer) in a project simulation.

Which pattern structures this collaboration?

**19️⃣** You want to instruct AI to generate a “Prompt Recipe” for building a research assistant.

What key components should your Recipe Pattern contain?

**20️⃣** You’re designing a multi-stage pipeline where data retrieval → summarization → sentiment analysis → reporting.

Which combination of patterns would produce the best results?

# ✅ **Answer Key & Explanations (Rebux Model)**

| **Q#** | **Correct Answer Summary** | **Rebux Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Game Play Pattern uses game mechanics to simulate learning or problem-solving. | Turns abstract reasoning into interactive tasks; enhances engagement and creativity. |
| 2 | Template Pattern standardizes prompt structure for reuse. | Critical for scalability, ensures format uniformity. |
| 3 | Meta-Language Pattern uses explicit markup or pseudo-code to direct behavior. | Gives fine-grained control (e.g., `<analyze>`, `<summarize>`). |
| 4 | Recipe Pattern defines a repeatable prompt “workflow” (like a cooking recipe). | Steps + structure + logic → predictable outcomes. |
| 5 | Alternative Approaches Pattern generates multiple reasoning paths for diversity. | Useful for brainstorming and bias reduction. |
| 6 | RAG combines LLM reasoning with retrieved factual data. | Mitigates hallucination by grounding responses in external knowledge. |
| 7 | Safety-Aware Prompting introduces constraints, filters, and self-check layers. | Reduces bias, ensures responsible AI output. |
| 8 | Prompt Orchestration coordinates multiple prompts via templates or RAG. | Controls flow between components of a pipeline. |
| 9 | Prompt Chaining connects dependent prompts; Templates define static forms. | Chaining = dynamic logic; Template = fixed frame. |
| 10 | Guardrails set non-negotiable boundaries for safe and factual generation. | Protects brand, compliance, and user trust. |
| 11 | Game Play Pattern (Persona + Scenario). | Adds interactive problem-solving flow. |
| 12 | Template Pattern. | Enforces rigid structure like JSON schema. |
| 13 | Meta-Language Pattern with tokens like `<define_term>` or `<expand>`. | Clarifies intent using machine-readable syntax. |
| 14 | Recipe + Critic-Helper Patterns. | Allows iterative teaching with feedback. |
| 15 | Use Alternative Approaches + FHC Evaluation. | Compare Faithfulness, Helpfulness, Cost scores. |
| 16 | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). | Ensures outputs are grounded in verified context. |
| 17 | Safety-Aware + Reflection Pattern. | Adds constraints and post-generation review. |
| 18 | Game Play + Multi-Agent Persona Pattern. | Assigns roles in cooperative task simulation. |
| 19 | Recipe should include: Purpose, Steps, Inputs, Output Schema, Verification. | Mimics procedural logic of workflows. |
| 20 | Template + RAG + Chaining + Reflection. | Pipeline architecture with modular reasoning. |

# 💬 **Reflection Assignment**

> Write a short 200-word reflection on how pattern integration changes your approach to designing prompts:
> 
> - Which pattern feels most natural in your workflow?
> - Which one do you find most powerful when combined with RAG or Safety layers?
> - How could templates and recipes improve the reproducibility of your work?

✅ Learners may submit reflections as a **Prompt Design Portfolio Entry** or **recorded explanation.**
