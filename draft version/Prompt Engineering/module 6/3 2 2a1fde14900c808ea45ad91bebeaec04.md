# 🧩 **1.3.3.2 Template Pattern**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ What Is the Template Pattern?**

The **Template Pattern** in prompt engineering is a **structured blueprint** for reusable prompt design.

Instead of writing prompts from scratch each time, you create a **parameterized framework** with **fixed sections** and **variable placeholders**.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of it like a Google Doc template for a resume — you don’t rewrite the layout; you just fill in the details.
> 
> In the same way, a **prompt template** defines *format, flow, and tone* so you can swap inputs quickly without changing the logic.
> 

✅ **Goal:** To ensure **consistency**, **efficiency**, and **scalability** across multiple AI tasks or products.

---

### **2️⃣ Why Template Patterns Matter**

As prompts evolve into complex workflows (content creation, data labeling, code generation, chat orchestration), small inconsistencies can break logic or produce unpredictable outputs.

Templates act as a **single source of truth** — ensuring structure, tone, and schema remain identical every time.

> 💬 Professional Analogy:
> 
> 
> In enterprise-grade systems like LangChain or DSPy, templates serve as the “model prompts” for every micro-task.
> 

✅ Templates turn prompts into **standardized components** of a larger pipeline.

### **3️⃣ Template Pattern Structure**

| **Section** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Header / Context** | Defines role and task. | “You are an expert financial analyst.” |
| **Instruction Block** | Specifies what to do. | “Summarize the following quarterly report.” |
| **Input Placeholder** | Indicates variable insertion. | “{{report_text}}” |
| **Formatting Rules** | Defines output schema. | “Output in JSON with keys: revenue, growth, insights.” |
| **Optional Extensions** | Add scoring, reflection, or verification. | “Verify each figure before reporting.” |

✅ *Template ≈ Fill-in-the-blanks prompt with embedded logic.*

---

### **4️⃣ Benefits of Using Templates**

| **Benefit** | **Impact** |
| --- | --- |
| 🧱 Consistency | Outputs follow identical format across all runs. |
| ⚙️ Automation | Easily reused in APIs and pipelines. |
| 🧭 Clarity | Reduces ambiguity and instruction drift. |
| 📈 Scalability | Works across multiple domains or teams. |
| 🔒 Safety | Prevents unstructured or off-topic responses. |

✅ Templates form the foundation of **enterprise prompt libraries** and **LLM-based products**.

---

### **5️⃣ Common Template Types**

| **Type** | **Use Case** |
| --- | --- |
| **Instruction Template** | Repeated reasoning or explanation tasks. |
| **Data Template** | Structured text → table or JSON. |
| **Persona Template** | Maintain tone and expertise for role-based AI. |
| **Workflow Template** | Multi-step task automation. |
| **Evaluation Template** | Self-grading or critique prompts. |

---

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Content Summarization Template**

```
[Role]
You are a professional summarizer.

[Task]
Summarize the given article objectively.

[Input]
{{article_text}}

[Format]
Output:
- Summary (≤ 120 words)
- Tone: Neutral
- Include 1 key quote.

```

✅ Output remains consistent no matter the content inserted.

---

### **Example 2 – Data Extraction Template**

```
You are an information extractor.
Task: Identify structured fields from text.

Input: {{document_text}}

Output JSON Schema:
{
  "company_name": "",
  "industry": "",
  "revenue": "",
  "country": ""
}

```

✅ Consistent schema = reliable parsing for data pipelines.

---

### **Example 3 – Persona Template**

```
Role: Expert Career Coach
Task: Provide personalized resume advice.

Input: {{resume_text}}

Rules:
- Be concise.
- Use supportive tone.
- End with a 3-step action plan.

```

✅ Templates ensure persona consistency across multiple interactions.

---

### **Example 4 – Workflow Template**

```
1. Understand the user's query.
2. Retrieve 3 relevant data points.
3. Summarize findings.
4. Reflect on accuracy.
5. Output structured answer.

Input: {{user_query}}

```

✅ Great for **chain-of-thought orchestration** or multi-agent logic.

---

### **Example 5 – Evaluation Template**

```
Evaluate the following AI-generated response.

Response: {{ai_output}}

Criteria:
1. Faithfulness
2. Helpfulness
3. Clarity

Score each 1–10 and provide a short feedback summary.

```

✅ Standardized evaluation prompt — compatible with instructor rubrics.

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Mini Project**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think of a repetitive AI task you perform often (e.g., summarizing text, writing explanations, or formatting data).
> 
> 
> How could you transform that workflow into a **Template Pattern**?
> 
> What placeholders and output structures would you use?
>

### **Quick Quiz**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What is the core idea of the Template Pattern? | Short Answer |
| 2 | Why are placeholders essential in templates? | Short Answer |
| 3 | Give one example of a business use case for templates. | Short Answer |
| 4 | How do templates improve LLM consistency? | Short Answer |
| 5 | What’s the main difference between a Template and a Prompt Chain? | Short Answer |

### **Answer Key**

| **Q#** | **Answer** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | It’s a reusable prompt structure with fixed format and variable content. | Ensures repeatability. |
| 2 | They allow dynamic data input. | Makes prompts flexible. |
| 3 | Automating report generation or data extraction. | Common enterprise use. |
| 4 | Same schema = predictable outputs. | Improves quality control. |
| 5 | Template = static blueprint; Chain = sequential logic steps. | Different abstraction levels. |

### **Mini Project – “Build a Prompt Template Library”**

> Goal: Create 3 reusable templates for different professional domains.
> 

| **Step** | **Instruction** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Pick three domains. | Education, Business, Coding. |
| 2️⃣ | Design prompt templates. | Summarizer, Analyst, Debugger. |
| 3️⃣ | Add placeholders. | {{text}}, {{data}}, {{code}} |
| 4️⃣ | Define output schema. | Table, JSON, markdown. |
| 5️⃣ | Test with different inputs. | Compare consistency and tone. |

✅ *Advanced Option:* Create a **meta-template** that can generate templates dynamically.
