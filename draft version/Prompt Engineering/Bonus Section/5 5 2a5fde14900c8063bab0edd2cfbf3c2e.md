# 🧩 **1.5.5 Case Studies: Marketing and Productivity**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Why Case Studies Matter**

Case studies transform abstract prompting theory into **real-world impact**.

They show how structured AI prompting improves **efficiency, creativity, and business outcomes** — without writing code or hiring engineers.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of each case study as a “prompt in action.”
> 
> Instead of talking *about* AI — we watch it perform, adapt, and deliver results.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> AI Prompt Case Study:
> 
> 
> A real or simulated example showing how prompt-driven workflows achieve measurable marketing, productivity, or communication outcomes.

### **2️⃣ The Two Core Domains**

| **Domain** | **Goal** | **Outcome** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Marketing** | Enhance brand communication, content creation, and campaigns. | Creative copy, visuals, and engagement. |
| **Productivity** | Automate workflows and reduce manual effort. | Time savings, consistency, and task clarity. |

✅ These domains represent **the top 2 real-world ROI drivers** for AI in non-technical careers.

### **3️⃣ The “MAP Framework” for Case Analysis**

When analyzing any AI use case, apply the **MAP** model:

| **Step** | **Meaning** | **Key Question** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M – Mission** | What problem was solved? | “Why did we use AI here?” |
| **A – Approach** | How was prompting applied? | “What was the process?” |
| **P – Performance** | What was the measurable result? | “How much did it improve efficiency or quality?” |

✅ MAP = clarity, replicability, and evaluation.
