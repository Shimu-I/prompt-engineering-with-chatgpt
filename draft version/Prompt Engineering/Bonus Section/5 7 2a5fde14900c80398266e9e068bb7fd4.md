## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ What Is Multimodal Storytelling?**

Multimodal storytelling means using **multiple media types** — text, image, sound, and motion — to convey a cohesive message or experience powered by AI.

This approach blends **creative writing**, **visual composition**, and **narrative sequencing** — all through prompt engineering.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of yourself as a *film director* and the AI tools as your creative crew.
> 
> One writes the script, one paints the scene, and another scores the soundtrack — all following your prompts.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Multimodal Prompting: The technique of combining or sequencing prompts across different media models (text, image, audio, video) to create integrated creative outputs.
>

### **2️⃣ Why It Matters for Non-Coders**

| **Creative Need** | **AI Capability** | **Example Tool / Prompt** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story writing | Generate narrative scripts | ChatGPT – “Act as a screenwriter” |
| Visuals | Generate illustrations or scenes | Midjourney / DALL·E 3 – “A fantasy village at sunset” |
| Voice narration | Convert script to audio | ElevenLabs / Runway – “Generate natural voiceover” |
| Video composition | Sync visuals and text | Runway ML / Pika / Synthesia |

✅ With prompting, **any creative idea** can become a multimedia project — no design or editing software needed.

---

### **3️⃣ The “SAVR” Framework for Multimodal Prompt Design**

| **Step** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S – Script** | Craft story flow and scenes | “Write a 3-act story outline about climate resilience.” |
| **A – Asset** | Generate visuals/audio for each scene | “Create an image of a futuristic eco-city at dusk.” |
| **V – Voice** | Add tone or narration prompts | “Narrate in an inspiring documentary style.” |
| **R – Render** | Combine outputs and finalize presentation | “Assemble text and images into storyboard format.” |

✅ SAVR = your **creative pipeline** — from imagination to presentation.

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Short Story + Visuals Project**

**Goal:** Create an illustrated micro-story using ChatGPT + Midjourney.

**Workflow:**

1️⃣ **Script with ChatGPT:**

```markdown
Act as a children’s author.
Write a 300-word bedtime story about a dragon who learns kindness.
Divide story into 3 scenes.

```

2️⃣ **Visuals with Midjourney:**

```markdown
“Cute watercolor dragon helping a lost fox in the forest, storybook style.”

```

3️⃣ **Combine:**

- Merge text + visuals in Canva, Notion, or PowerPoint.
- Add headings and captions per scene.

✅ *Result:* A finished illustrated story ready for publication or class use.

---

### **Example 2 – Brand Storytelling Campaign**

**Goal:** Build a brand story in multimedia format.

**Workflow:**

1️⃣ **Script with ChatGPT:**

```markdown
Act as a brand copywriter.
Write a 60-second ad script for a coffee brand about “moments of pause.”
Tone: cinematic, emotional, minimal dialogue.

```

2️⃣ **Visuals with Midjourney:**

```markdown
“Warm morning light through a coffee shop window, cinematic tone, bokeh effect.”

```

3️⃣ **Voiceover with ElevenLabs:**

> “Generate a calm, reflective female voice with soft background piano.”
> 

4️⃣ **Video Assembly with Runway ML:**

Combine script + visuals + voice into a 60s ad sequence.

✅ *Result:* A professional ad concept generated entirely through prompts — no camera, no code.

---

### **Example 3 – Educational Storyboard**

**Goal:** Teach a complex topic through storytelling.

**Workflow:**

1️⃣ ChatGPT → Write dialogue between a teacher and student explaining “Blockchain.”

2️⃣ Midjourney → Create infographics for each key concept.

3️⃣ Notion or Slides → Compile into comic or explainer storyboard.

4️⃣ Optional: Add AI narration via Synthesia or Runway.

✅ *Result:* Visual and conversational learning material built from prompts.

---

### **Example 4 – Audio Narrative**

**Goal:** Create a short podcast-style story.

1️⃣ ChatGPT → Generate a script about “AI ethics in 2030.”

2️⃣ Gemini → Add real-world facts and statistics.

3️⃣ ElevenLabs → Convert narration to human-like voice.

4️⃣ Runway → Add light ambient music and export.

✅ *Result:* 3-minute AI-generated audio experience.

---

### **Example 5 – Multimodal Portfolio Prompt**

> Combine all your multimodal assets into one interactive portfolio using Notion, Google Sites, or GitHub Pages.
> 

✅ Use your SAVR outputs to demonstrate:

- Narrative flow (Script)
- Visual harmony (Asset)
- Emotional tone (Voice)
- Professional presentation (Render)

---

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Practice**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> What story or message could you tell using multiple AI tools?
> 
> 
> Think about:
> 
> - What emotion do you want to evoke?
> - Which medium (text, image, voice) fits it best?
> - How could AI help you bring it to life?
