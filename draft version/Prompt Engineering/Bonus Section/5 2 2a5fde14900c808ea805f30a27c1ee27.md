## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ Why Research Prompting Matters**

Research can be overwhelming — papers, reports, data, and opinions scattered across the web.

AI can help, but **only if prompted correctly**.

Instead of asking, *“Summarize this,”* a skilled prompt engineer structures instructions that clarify **depth, accuracy, and perspective.**

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of AI as your research intern. It’s smart, fast, and tireless — but only as useful as your **instructions and supervision.**
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Research Prompting = Using structured language prompts to extract, summarize, analyze, and compare complex information while preserving accuracy and attribution.

### **2️⃣ Principles of Effective Research Prompts**

| **Principle** | **Why It Matters** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Specific Scope** | Avoids generic overviews. | “Summarize only the economic impacts of climate change (2015–2020).” |
| **Bias Awareness** | Ensures fairness. | “Include at least one counterargument.” |
| **Structured Output** | Improves readability. | “Return results as a 3-column table: claim, evidence, source.” |
| **Source Citation** | Builds credibility. | “List source titles and publication dates.” |
| **Verification Loop** | Reduces hallucinations. | “Ask me to confirm uncertain data.” |

✅ Good prompts act like **mini research protocols.**

### **3️⃣ The 4 Types of Research Prompts**

| **Type** | **Goal** | **Example Prompt** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Summarization** | Condense content into key takeaways. | “Summarize this PDF into 5 main findings.” |
| **Comparison** | Highlight similarities/differences. | “Compare OpenAI and Anthropic research approaches.” |
| **Synthesis** | Merge multiple sources into insights. | “Combine these two reports into a unified conclusion.” |
| **Critical Review** | Evaluate strength of arguments. | “Critique this study’s methodology in plain language.” |

✅ Each type builds your analytical precision — no code required.

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Academic Summary Prompt**

```markdown
Act as an academic research assistant.
Summarize this article into 5 bullet points.
Include key findings, limitations, and future research directions.
Add a short paragraph: “What this means in real-world terms.”

```

✅ *Why it works:* Clarifies both *content* (what) and *context* (why it matters).

---

### **Example 2 – Comparative Analysis Prompt**

```markdown
Compare these two studies on renewable energy policy.
Highlight:
1. Research goals
2. Methods used
3. Main conclusions
4. Points of disagreement
Return results as a markdown table.

```

✅ *Why it works:* Structured tabular output promotes critical synthesis.

---

### **Example 3 – Bias-Aware Summarization**

```markdown
Summarize this news article.
Then list 2 possible biases or framing choices.
Suggest how to fact-check or reframe neutrally.

```

✅ *Why it works:* Adds **ethical literacy** to research interpretation.

---

### **Example 4 – Citation-Enhanced Prompt**

```markdown
Summarize the following sources with citations:
- [Paper A Title]
- [Paper B Title]
List results as:
1. Claim
2. Evidence Summary
3. Source (Author, Year)

```

✅ *Why it works:* Teaches academic structure and sourcing habits.

---

### **Example 5 – Multi-Document Synthesizer**

```markdown
You are an AI literature reviewer.
Read and synthesize these 3 abstracts.
Output:
- Consensus findings
- Contradictions
- Knowledge gaps
Return results in bullet form.

```

✅ *Why it works:* Simulates how human researchers conduct literature reviews.

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Practice**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think of a recent article, report, or lecture you read.
> 
> 
> How could you rewrite your AI prompt to focus on *insights*, not *summaries*?
> 
> Ask yourself:
> 
> - Did the AI help me think critically?
> - Did I verify its claims?
> - Could I publish this summary with confidence?

---

### **Quick Quiz**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What are the four types of research prompts? | Short Answer |
| 2 | Why should every research prompt include a verification loop? | Short Answer |
| 3 | What’s the main difference between summarization and synthesis? | Short Answer |
| 4 | Why is bias-awareness essential in AI research? | Short Answer |
| 5 | Write a prompt that compares two articles and identifies biases. | Practical |

### **Answer Key (Rebux Format)**

| **Q#** | **Answer** | **Explanation (Rebux)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Summarization, Comparison, Synthesis, Critical Review. | Core categories of research prompting. |
| 2 | To ensure factual accuracy and avoid hallucinated details. | Confirms human-AI collaboration accuracy. |
| 3 | Summarization condenses; synthesis combines insights. | Synthesis builds higher-level understanding. |
| 4 | Bias affects credibility and neutrality of results. | Essential for ethical research practices. |
| 5 | “Compare these two news articles. Identify bias tone and rephrase both neutrally.” | Demonstrates applied bias detection. |

### **Mini Project – “AI Research Partner Setup”**

> Goal: Design a reusable AI research prompt library.
> 

| **Step** | **Instruction** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Create a folder or Notion page for “AI Research Prompts.” | Label by use case. |
| 2️⃣ | Add 3 templates: summarization, comparison, critique. | Store ready-to-use prompts. |
| 3️⃣ | Test on one topic of your choice. | “AI in Education” |
| 4️⃣ | Adjust for tone, depth, and citation style. | APA or MLA formats. |
| 5️⃣ | Share template with peers or team. | Promotes research literacy. |

✅ *Advanced Option:* Pair ChatGPT + Zotero for automatic reference generation.
