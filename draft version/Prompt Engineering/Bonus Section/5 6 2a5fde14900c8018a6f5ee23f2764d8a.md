# 🧩 **1.5.6 Practice: Daily Task Automation Prompt**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ What Is Daily Task Automation?**

Daily Task Automation means using AI to handle repetitive tasks — like summarizing emails, creating reports, or planning your day — with *smart prompting* instead of code.

You design a **prompt-driven workflow** once and reuse it every day.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Imagine training a virtual assistant who *never forgets your instructions.*
> 
> That’s what prompt-based automation does — it remembers the structure so you can focus on results.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Daily Task Automation Prompt:
> 
> 
> A structured prompt (or sequence of prompts) that performs a repeatable daily activity using AI tools — often integrated with Notion, Zapier, Make, or Gmail.
>

### **2️⃣ Why It Matters for Non-Coders**

| **Challenge** | **How AI Helps** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time-consuming admin tasks | Automate summaries & reports | “Summarize yesterday’s tasks and emails.” |
| Lack of consistency | Reuse templates | “Create a daily report in the same format.” |
| Forgetting follow-ups | Auto reminders & logs | “List pending items with deadlines.” |

✅ **You don’t need to code — you just need clarity and repetition.**

---

### **3️⃣ The “TASK Loop Framework”**

Use this framework to design your automation prompts:

| **Step** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T – Trigger** | When does the task run? | Every morning at 8 AM |
| **A – Action** | What should the AI do? | Summarize yesterday’s notes |
| **S – Structure** | How should results look? | Table + checklist |
| **K – Knowledge** | What background/context is needed? | Yesterday’s tasks from Notion |

✅ *TASK = your repeatable workflow logic.*

---

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Daily Summary Prompt**

```markdown
Act as my personal assistant.
Summarize all my tasks from yesterday:
- Completed items
- Pending tasks
- Key insights
Return as a Markdown table with columns: Task | Status | Priority | Notes.

```

✅ *Why it works:* Simple structure + clear schema = ready for daily reuse.

---

### **Example 2 – Morning Planning Prompt**

```markdown
Act as a productivity coach.
Based on my to-do list:
1. Prioritize tasks by urgency.
2. Suggest a focused 3-hour plan.
3. Add one motivational quote for the day.
Return in bullet points.

```

✅ Adds motivation and structure to your day.

---

### **Example 3 – Email Summary Prompt**

```markdown
Act as an email analyst.
Summarize the last 20 unread emails from my inbox.
Highlight:
- Key requests
- Urgent deadlines
- Follow-up actions
Return in 3 bullet sections.

```

✅ Great when used with Gmail + Zapier integration.

---

### **Example 4 – End-of-Day Reflection Prompt**

```markdown
You are my reflection coach.
Summarize today’s achievements.
Ask me:
1. What went well?
2. What I can improve tomorrow?
3. One gratitude statement.

```

✅ Encourages habit tracking and self-awareness.

---

### **Example 5 – Automation Chain Example (Zapier / Make)**

**Goal:** Automatically generate a daily summary using ChatGPT + Notion.

| **Step** | **Tool** | **Action** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Zapier | Trigger at 7 PM every day |
| 2️⃣ | ChatGPT | Run “End-of-Day Reflection” prompt |
| 3️⃣ | Notion | Save summary into “Daily Log” database |
| 4️⃣ | Email | Send report to yourself |

✅ *Result:* A self-updating daily journal — no coding, just prompt chaining.

---

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Practice**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think about your daily routine.
> 
> 
> What 2–3 tasks could AI handle automatically?
> 
> Ask yourself:
> 
> - What’s repetitive?
> - What format do I always use?
> - Could I schedule it to run automatically with a prompt?
> 
> Start building your “Daily AI Loop.”
