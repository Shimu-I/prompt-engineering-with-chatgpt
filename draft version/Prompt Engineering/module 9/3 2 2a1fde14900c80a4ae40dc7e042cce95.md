# 🧩 **1.4.3.2 Ethical Prompt Design**

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ What Is Ethical Prompt Design?**

**Ethical Prompt Design** is the art and discipline of crafting AI instructions that promote **accuracy, fairness, transparency, and responsibility** in how models respond.

It ensures that the AI does not just *work well* — but *works ethically*.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Imagine you’re a teacher giving exam questions.
> 
> A well-written question challenges thinking; a poorly written one confuses or misleads.
> 
> Ethical prompt design does the same — it shapes *how* the AI reasons and what values guide its output.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Ethical Prompt Design = Creating AI prompts that align with moral, social, and professional standards to prevent harm, bias, or misuse.
>

### **2️⃣ Why Ethics Matter in Prompt Engineering**

| **Ethical Dimension** | **Why It Matters** | **Example Risk** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Truthfulness** | Ensures accuracy and factual reliability. | Misinformation spread. |
| **Fairness** | Avoids bias toward gender, race, or group. | Discriminatory responses. |
| **Transparency** | Shows reasoning and limitations clearly. | Hidden manipulations. |
| **Accountability** | Keeps human responsibility visible. | “AI told me to” fallacy. |
| **Privacy** | Protects sensitive or personal information. | Data leakage or exposure. |

✅ In essence: ethical design *protects people*, *preserves trust*, and *prevents misuse.*

---

### **3️⃣ The Ethical Design Spectrum**

Ethical prompt engineering sits between two extremes:

- **Under-guided AI:** too vague → risky freedom
- **Over-controlled AI:** too restrictive → limited creativity

| **Prompt Type** | **Outcome** |
| --- | --- |
| “Tell me everything about politics.” | Risk: biased or extreme views |
| “Summarize neutral facts about political systems from verified sources.” | Balanced, ethical output |

✅ *Ethics = balance* between freedom and responsibility.

---

### **4️⃣ Ethical Design Principles**

| **Principle** | **Application in Prompting** | **Example Prompt Practice** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Accuracy** | Use verified or cited sources. | “Include citations only from official datasets.” |
| **2. Respect** | Avoid harmful or biased framing. | “Explain cultural impact respectfully.” |
| **3. Fairness** | Represent multiple perspectives. | “Summarize both sides of the argument.” |
| **4. Consent** | Avoid generating private data. | “Use only anonymized examples.” |
| **5. Accountability** | Disclose AI limitations. | “Note this result may not be 100% accurate.” |

✅ These principles guide both prompt creation and AI deployment.

---

### **5️⃣ Ethics by Design – The “PREP” Model**

To apply ethical prompting systematically, use the **PREP** mnemonic:

| **Letter** | **Meaning** | **Prompting Action** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P – Purpose** | Why am I prompting this AI? | Define intent (education, analysis, creativity). |
| **R – Risk** | Could this harm someone? | Consider bias, misinformation, misuse. |
| **E – Equity** | Does it represent everyone fairly? | Avoid loaded language or stereotypes. |
| **P – Privacy** | Am I protecting data and identity? | Never include sensitive or identifying info. |

✅ The PREP model makes ethical reasoning part of every prompt design.

---

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Ethical vs Unethical Prompt**

| **Prompt** | **Analysis** |
| --- | --- |
| ❌ “Describe why one gender is better at programming.” | Encourages biased reasoning. |
| ✅ “Discuss factors influencing representation in programming fields.” | Neutral, data-driven, inclusive. |

---

### **Example 2 – Ethics in Creative Prompts**

**Unethical:**

> “Write a fake medical claim about a new cure.”
> 

**Ethical Revision:**

> “Write a fictional short story where a character discovers a cure — clearly labeled as fiction.”
> 

✅ Ethics is not about restricting creativity — it’s about framing it responsibly.

---

### **Example 3 – Privacy and Anonymity**

**Prompt:**

> “Generate a case study using anonymous data about healthcare challenges.”
> 

✅ Reinforces data protection while maintaining realism.

---

### **Example 4 – Fact Verification**

**Prompt:**

> “Summarize verified information about vaccine effectiveness using WHO and CDC data.”
> 

✅ Combines truthfulness with citation-based grounding — the ideal ethical prompt design.

---

### **Example 5 – Mitigating Harmful Outputs**

**Prompt:**

> “Explain cybersecurity risks without teaching harmful exploits.”
> 

✅ Defines boundaries — educational but safe.

---

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Mini Project**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think about one prompt you’ve written that could have ethical implications (e.g., misinformation, bias, or misuse).
> 
> 
> How could you rewrite it using the **PREP model** to make it safer and more responsible?
>

### **Mini Project – “Ethical Prompt Re-Design”**

> Goal: Redesign unethical prompts into responsible ones using the PREP model.
> 

| **Step** | **Instruction** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Identify 3 risky prompts (bias, misinformation, or privacy). | “Why are certain groups less intelligent?” |
| 2️⃣ | Analyze ethical flaws. | Stereotyping, offensive framing. |
| 3️⃣ | Rewrite each using PREP. | “Discuss how access to education affects performance.” |
| 4️⃣ | Validate through ADA. | Check bias-free tone and factual grounding. |
| 5️⃣ | Reflect on improved clarity and fairness. | Summarize insights learned. |

✅ *Advanced Option:* Create a “Prompt Ethics Checklist” for your own projects.
