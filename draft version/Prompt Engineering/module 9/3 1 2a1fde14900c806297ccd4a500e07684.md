---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ What Are AI Hallucinations?**

An **AI hallucination** occurs when a language model like ChatGPT generates information that is **factually incorrect, fabricated, or unsupported** by its input data or context.

It’s not “lying” intentionally — it’s *confidently wrong*.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of hallucinations like a student who’s great at writing essays but sometimes *makes up citations* to sound smart.
> 
> The format is perfect, the tone is convincing — but the facts are false.
> 

✅ **Definition:**

> Hallucination = A believable yet inaccurate or nonfactual output produced by an AI model due to incomplete context, flawed reasoning, or probabilistic generation.
>

### **2️⃣ Why Hallucinations Happen**

LLMs (Large Language Models) predict words based on **probabilities**, not truth.

They don’t “know” facts; they **simulate plausible text continuations**.

| **Cause** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lack of grounding** | No external verification of facts | “The Eiffel Tower is in Berlin.” |
| **Prompt ambiguity** | Unclear or underspecified question | “Who invented energy?” |
| **Overconfidence bias** | Model assumes context | “The 2026 iPhone XZ will have holograms.” |
| **Training data gaps** | Missing or outdated data | Model cites old sources as current. |
| **Excessive creativity** | Temperature too high | Adds “invented” details to fill gaps. |

✅ LLMs are not databases — they’re *probabilistic storytellers*.

Without grounding or constraints, hallucination risk increases.

### **3️⃣ Types of Hallucinations**

| **Type** | **Example Output** | **Risk Level** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Factual** | Incorrect numbers, names, or facts | ⚠️ Medium |
| **Logical** | Wrong reasoning or flawed conclusions | ⚠️ High |
| **Referential** | Invented sources, URLs, or quotes | ⚠️ Very High |
| **Contextual** | Confuses entities or times | ⚠️ Medium |
| **Procedural** | Missteps in task execution | ⚠️ High |

✅ Knowing these helps in designing **trustworthy prompts** that anticipate and minimize hallucination risks.

---

### **4️⃣ Key Insight: Probabilities vs Truth**

LLMs are trained to produce *likely continuations*, not *verified statements*.

The more open-ended the question, the more freedom (and danger) the model has to hallucinate.

> 💡 Pro Tip:
> 
> 
> “AI doesn’t know — it predicts. To get truth, guide prediction.”

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Ambiguous Prompt → Hallucination**

**Prompt:**

> “List all Nobel Prize winners in 2025.”
> 

**Problem:**

No grounding data exists for 2025 (future event).

**AI Hallucination:**

Invents plausible-sounding winners.

**Fix:**

> “List the Nobel Prize winners as of 2024 and explain when 2025 results will be announced.”
> 

---

### **Example 2 – Overgeneralized Statement**

**Prompt:**

> “Summarize all causes of climate change.”
> 

**Issue:**

Too broad; the model fills gaps with pseudo-facts.

**Fix:**

> “Summarize scientifically verified human-related causes of climate change using the IPCC framework.”
> 

---

### **Example 3 – False Reference Hallucination**

**Prompt:**

> “Provide 3 research papers supporting that coffee improves memory.”
> 

**Issue:**

Model might invent papers.

**Fix:**

> “Provide real, verifiable studies on coffee and memory improvement with DOI or PubMed links only.”
> 

---

### **Example 4 – Procedural Error Hallucination**

**Prompt:**

> “Write Python code to access a non-existent function predictAI().”
> 

**Issue:**

Model creates fake API or syntax.

**Fix:**

> “Write a Python script using valid libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) for prediction tasks.”
> 

---

### **Example 5 – Overconfidence Bias**

**Prompt:**

> “Explain the 2028 Mars mission results.”
> 

**Issue:**

Model infers results that don’t exist.

**Fix:**

> “Summarize current Mars mission goals and expected timelines as of 2025.”
> 

---

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Mini Project**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think about your recent interactions with AI tools.
> 
> 
> Did you ever receive an answer that *sounded right* but wasn’t actually true?
> 
> How could you redesign that prompt to enforce verification and grounding?
>

### **Quick Quiz**

| **Q#** | **Question** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What is an AI hallucination? | Short Answer |
| 2 | Why do hallucinations occur in LLMs? | Short Answer |
| 3 | List two common causes of hallucination. | Short Answer |
| 4 | What’s the difference between probabilistic output and factual truth? | Short Answer |
| 5 | How can prompts reduce hallucination risk? | Short Answer |

---

### **Answer Key**

| **Q#** | **Answer** | **Explanation (Rebux)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Fabricated or false AI-generated information. | The model outputs confident but wrong data. |
| 2 | Because models predict word probabilities, not facts. | LLMs simulate plausible continuations. |
| 3 | Ambiguous prompts and missing context. | Both force AI to “fill gaps.” |
| 4 | Probability = what’s likely; truth = what’s verified. | AI generates plausible, not factual, text. |
| 5 | Add context, grounding, and constraints. | Use verified data, ask for sources. |

### **Mini Project – “Hallucination Detection Lab”**

> Goal: Create and test prompts that deliberately induce and then fix hallucinations.
> 

| **Step** | **Instruction** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Write 3 open-ended prompts likely to hallucinate. | “Explain future Nobel winners.” |
| 2️⃣ | Observe and note errors or invented details. | Document each hallucination. |
| 3️⃣ | Revise prompts to force grounded output. | “List **verified** Nobel winners (cite year).” |
| 4️⃣ | Compare outputs before and after fixing. | Evaluate factual difference. |
| 5️⃣ | Summarize what design patterns reduced hallucination. | Provide lessons learned. |

✅ *Advanced Option:* Build a **“Hallucination Stress Test” prompt template** that intentionally probes AI accuracy boundaries.

### **Instructor Rubric (Optional)**

| **Criterion** | **Score (1–10)** | **Focus Area** |

| Concept Understanding |  | Defines and classifies hallucinations correctly |
| Prompt Correction |  | Effectively mitigates errors |
| Reflection Depth |  | Analyzes cause–effect relationships |
| Experimentation Quality |  | Tests multiple prompt strategies |
