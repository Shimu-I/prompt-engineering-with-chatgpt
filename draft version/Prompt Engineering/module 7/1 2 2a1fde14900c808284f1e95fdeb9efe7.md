# 🧩 **1.4.1.2 Ask-for-Input and Outline Expansion Patterns**

---

This section explores **interactive prompt design**, where the model doesn’t just *generate* — it *collaborates* by **asking for clarification, collecting user input, and expanding structured outlines** into detailed responses.

These patterns are vital for **LLM-based applications**, **educational assistants**, and **workflow generators** that adapt dynamically to users.

---

## **Part A – Concept Foundations**

---

### **1️⃣ What Is the Ask-for-Input Pattern?**

The **Ask-for-Input Pattern** teaches the model to *pause*, *query the user*, and *gather missing information* before executing a task.

> 🧠 Analogy:
> 
> 
> Think of it as the “Socratic Method” for AI — rather than assuming it knows everything, the model engages in dialogue to understand the context first.
> 

✅ **Goal:** Increase task accuracy, personalization, and user engagement.

---

### **2️⃣ Why It Matters**

Many AI errors come from incomplete instructions or vague context.

Instead of guessing, a well-designed prompt **asks clarifying questions**, ensuring better alignment before output generation.

| **Without Ask-for-Input** | **With Ask-for-Input** |
| --- | --- |
| “Write a business email.” | “Before I write, who is your audience and what’s the purpose of the email?” |

✅ The second approach avoids hallucination and mismatched tone.

---

### **3️⃣ Core Design Framework**

| **Component** | **Function** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Instruction Phase** | Defines role and task. | “You are a project planner.” |
| **Inquiry Phase** | Ask specific clarification questions. | “Who is the target user? What’s the timeline?” |
| **Response Phase** | Use inputs to generate final result. | “Here’s your detailed plan based on your answers.” |
| **Reflection Phase** | Verify alignment with the user’s intent. | “Did this match your expectations?” |

✅ The model behaves like an **interactive assistant** rather than a static tool.

---

### **4️⃣ What Is the Outline Expansion Pattern?**

The **Outline Expansion Pattern** converts **brief outlines or bullet points** into detailed, structured outputs — essays, reports, scripts, code, or documentation.

> 🧩 It acts like a creative amplifier:
> 
> 
> You give it a sketch → it turns it into a full picture.
> 

✅ **Goal:** Scale small ideas into coherent, logical, and professional deliverables.

---

### **5️⃣ Why These Two Patterns Work Well Together**

| **Stage** | **Pattern Used** | **Result** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clarify | Ask-for-Input | Collect context and requirements. |
| Structure | Outline Expansion | Build framework or sections. |
| Elaborate | Recipe or Template | Generate detailed, formatted content. |
| Reflect | Reflection Pattern | Ensure output matches goals. |

> 💡 Professional Insight:
> 
> 
> This combined design is the backbone of many tools like **Notion AI’s document builder**, **ChatGPT custom instructions**, and **GitHub Copilot’s project assistants**.

---

## **Part B – Application and Examples**

---

### **Example 1 – Ask-for-Input (Email Generator)**

```
System:
You are a professional email assistant.

Step 1: Ask these questions before writing:
- Who is the recipient?
- What is the purpose?
- What tone should I use?

Step 2: Once all answers are given, generate the email.

Response format:
{
  "email_subject": "",
  "email_body": ""
}

```

✅ The AI becomes conversational and context-aware before generation.

---

### **Example 2 – Outline Expansion (Report Writer)**

```
System:
You are a technical writer.

Input Outline:
1. Introduction
2. Challenges
3. Solutions
4. Future Recommendations

Task:
Expand the outline into a full 500-word structured report.
Each section should include transitions and data references.

```

✅ Converts a skeleton outline into a logically cohesive report.

---

### **Example 3 – Combined Pattern (AI Course Builder)**

```
Role: You are an instructional designer.

Task:
1. Ask user for course topic and audience type.
2. Generate a 5-point outline.
3. Expand each point into a full section with examples.

Output Schema:
{
  "topic": "",
  "audience": "",
  "outline": [],
  "expanded_sections": {}
}

```

✅ Demonstrates a **multi-step pipeline**: clarify → structure → expand.

---

### **Example 4 – Developer Assistant (Code Generator)**

```
System:
You are a coding assistant.

Ask:
- What language are you using?
- What’s the goal of the function?

Outline Expansion:
Given this outline:
1. Input validation
2. Core logic
3. Output formatting

Generate complete code with comments.

```

✅ Context collection + structured generation = robust, customized code.

---

### **Example 5 – Educational Tutor (Interactive + Expansion)**

```
Role: AI Tutor

Ask:
- What subject are you studying?
- What level of detail do you need?

Outline Expansion:
1. Define key concepts.
2. Provide examples.
3. Add short quiz.

Reflect: “Did this help clarify the topic?”

```

✅ Ideal for **adaptive learning** systems and personalized teaching tools.

---

## **Part C – Reflection, Quiz & Mini Project**

---

### **Reflection Prompt**

> Think about a project or workflow where users often provide incomplete instructions.
> 
> 
> How could you use the Ask-for-Input pattern to collect missing details?
> 
> Once the input is gathered, how could the Outline Expansion pattern turn it into a structured deliverable?
>
