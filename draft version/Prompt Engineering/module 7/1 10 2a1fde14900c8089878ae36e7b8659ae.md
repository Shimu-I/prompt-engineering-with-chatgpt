### **2️⃣ Project Brief**

> Scenario:
> 
> 
> You are leading the development of a **prompt-based AI platform** for a client.
> 
> The system must perform a **real-world function** such as:
> 
> - Automating content generation
> - Evaluating data or reports
> - Running multi-agent research workflows
> - Managing safe retrieval-augmented reasoning
> - Providing adaptive, user-personalized feedback

✅ You must design a **Prompt OS-powered application** that is **modular, auditable, and scalable**.

### **4️⃣ Example: “AI Legal Brief Assistant”**

### 🧠 Purpose:

Generate, verify, and summarize legal briefs for law firms.

### 🧩 Workflow:

1. **Retriever Agent:** Fetches relevant case files.
2. **Analyzer Agent:** Extracts key legal precedents.
3. **Critic Agent:** Reviews logic and detects bias.
4. **Safety Agent:** Redacts sensitive information.
5. **Writer Agent:** Generates final report in Markdown.

### ⚙️ Patterns Used:

- **RAG Pattern** – factual grounding
- **Recipe Pattern** – structured reasoning
- **Reflection Pattern** – self-assessment loop
- **Safety-Aware Pattern** – controlled refusals

### 🧾 Output Schema:

```json
{
  "case_summary": "",
  "key_precedents": [],
  "confidence_score": 9.2,
  "safety_status": "approved"
}

```

### 🧩 Reflection:

“Ensure all case references are publicly available. Avoid assumptions about ongoing cases.”

### **Answer Key**

| **Q#** | **Answer (Summary)** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Enables composability, structure, and flexibility. |
| 2 | Reflection allows the model to assess its own reasoning for accuracy. |
| 3 | Safety Agents act actively; Guards are rule-based checks. |
| 4 | Orchestration defines the flow of reasoning and agent collaboration. |
| 5 | Modular design allows isolated debugging and iteration. |
| 6 | Enforce source citations and fact-check layers. |
| 7 | LangChain, DSPy, AutoGen for agent orchestration. |
| 8 | Agent A produces, Agent B verifies — connected via chain or graph. |
| 9 | Use templates, logging, and deterministic settings (temp=0). |
| 10 | Integrate Guards, logs, and monitoring dashboards. |
| 11 | Add pre- and post-generation validation prompts. |
| 12 | Simulate attacks or misuse cases internally. |
